  'content': u"Michael S. Myslobodsky, ed.,\nThe Mythomanias: The Nature of Deception and Self -deception.\nHillsdale NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, 1996, pp. 23-50.\nDeception: A View from the Rationalist Perspective\nBy Joseph Agassi,\nTel Aviv University and York University, Toro nto\nSelf- Deception in General\n&#34;A Liberal Decalogue&#34; suggests (Russell, 1967, pp. 60-61) not\nto envy people who live in a fool's paradise: It is a place only\nfor fools. This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's\nparadise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of\nopinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down,\nthat reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when\nall is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of\ntheir situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to\nget them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is\nlittle that can be done about it, except that the wise would still\nprefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic\nmore constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the\nreassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable\nalternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - -\nso that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to\nmobilize some appropriate action.\nAlternatively, fools may tell themselves that there is no risk.\nThis is self- deception, and the question is, why do people\ndeceive themselves and take risks? To take a concrete\nexample, people with weak hearts may avoid taking precautions\nand prefer to live like normal people and risk instant death\nfrom heart failure. This is possibly a rational choice. Yet some\nwho suffer from weak hearts pretend, even to themselves, that\nthey are normal. It is hard then to say whether they have\nchosen to live normally and take the risk. Perhaps they prefer\nto take precautions, and yet do not do so because they are\nunable to look the risk straight in the face.\nMore sophisticated ways of living in a fool's paradise are\nknown. One may live there knowingly. One may feel that one\ndoes not share the reassuring received opinion, yet pretend\nthat one does. This is what Russell warned against: Anyone\nwho knowingly chooses to live in a fool's paradise is still a fool.\nAnyone who thinks that awareness of one's living in a fool's\nparadise immunizes one to its dangers is a fool. This is self-\ndeception about one's ability to cope with deceit. Many\nphilosophers have noted that people who habitually deceive\nfinally fall for their own deceptions. This is the well-known\nphenomenon that confidence artists appeal to the willingness of\ntheir victims to deceive both themselves and others in one and\nthe same act: The victims are encouraged to deceive\nthemselves into thinking that they deceive only others while\nignoring their own greed and the immorality of the way they\nchoose to satisfy it. To this Russell added that the same holds\ntrue for all self -deception: Those who think they can live in\nsituation of self-deception without deceiving themselves finally\nfall for their own self-deception. The seemingly wise deceive\nthemselves that they only pretend that they endorse the\nreassuring hypothesis: They do not know the cost of the\npretense, which is the neglect of thinking out the viable\nalternatives.\nThe reason one endorses the reassuring hypothesis despite\nattempts to immunize oneself is complex. It is in part\nintellectual: One does not invest in the examination of\nalternative hypotheses. It is in part social: One cannot discuss\nalternative possibilities when one pretends to the world that\none is committed to the reassuring hypothesis. It is in part\npsychological: One is ambivalent about matters, and one\nreassures oneself that one does not need the reassurance.\nThe case of self- deception, in brief, is complex. It involves\nerror, impatience in thinking out detailed matters,\nunwillingness to examine each and every obvious option, and\nalso deception proper. Yet clearly something is missing here: It\nis fear and obsession. As Freud was first to notice, self-\ndeception usually rests on the stubborn reluctance to consider\nalternatives when these are suggested by others.\nNot all cases of self -deception, however, are cases of life in\nfool's paradise. This phenomenon is usually associated with the\nself-deception that involves whole social groups. The social\ncase is more complex than the personal case. The personal\ncase of self -deception is puzzling because its victims refuse to\nconsider corrections suggested by their environment. The case\nof the fool's paradise that is group self -deception, usually\nnational, is different and more complex: A whole society\ndeclares a certain option not open to public discussion. Its\ngiven rationale is that it is dangerous to discuss different\noptions -- because it will help other people or discourage our\npeople. Indeed, it is very similar to the case of the confidence\nartist: The group (national) leadership suggests that, although\nour case may be shaky, we may be able to succeed if it will be\nnevertheless accepted, and for this it should be presented with\nfull confidence. All that is missing from the picture to complete\nit are two true observations. First, many political leaders are\nconfidence tricksters, and they see themselves as such.\nSecond, confidence tricksters make a profession of deceiving\nthemselves that they deceive only others. In principle, the n,\nthe difference between the two cases -- the private and the\npublic -- is only technical: Both are cases of reluctance -- of\nnot allowing oneself to examine views that deserve to be\nexamined, where an excuse for this reluctance is left\nunexamined as well . The two cases differ as to the excuse\noffered for the reluctance. To make the difference purely\ntechnical, what is needed is to observe, as is explained in detail\nhere, that any effort to present a case authoritatively -- be it\npersonal, social, politica l, or intellectual -- is in itself nothing\nshort of self-deception.\nIn summary, when one deceives oneself, one does not know the\ncost of the self -deception, and it is usually this that makes the\nerror significant. In other words, however irrational any c ase of\nself-deception looks, when one unpacks it, one finds it not very\nproblematic. The inability to see this rests on a difficulty that\nenters the picture with the introduction of a theory of\nrationality. Two important theories of rationality are found in\nWestern philosophy. The earlier of the tow is the more\nimportant. It was known as the rationlist theory, and now it is\nknown as classical rationalism. It identifies rational action with\none based on rational belief and rational belief as that which\nrests on proof of sorts (Agassi, 1986a; Agassi &amp; Jarvie, 1987,\nChapter 16.) The other important theory is romanticism: It\nidentifies rational action with one based on strong intuition:\nOne acts rationally when one is true to one's inner self, when\none listens to the right inner voice. This theory, be it true or\nfalse, is not given to rational discussion for the following\nreason. There is only one argument against it: By listening to\none's inner voice, one can make tragic decisions. The followers\nof the romantic theory of rationality are not dissuaded by this\nargument for reasons that are good or bad. Whatever is the\ntruth of the matter, the followers of the romantic theory are\nunshakable. Hence, there is no point in pursuing this discussion\nunless and until someone comes up with a new suggestion (for\ndetails see Agassi, 1982).\nThe rest of this chapter is devoted to a discussion of the\nclassical theory of rationality and of its implications for the\ncase of self -deception. At the end, a new avenue for the theory\no f rationality is highlighted. The newer theory of rationality is\nmore commonsensical, as it takes rationality to be a matter of\ntrial and error. Thus, it permits the discussion to proceed along\nthe lines suggested here.\nRationality and the Social Order\nThe prevalence of self -deception is part of folk knowledge; it is\nthe target of a rich folk literature, and of more sophisticated\nliterature as well. It has not puzzled people, however, until the\nadvent of modern times. The reason is not far to seek: The\nphenomenon began to puzzle people when it conflicted with\nreceived opinion and/or when it constituted a challenge that\nwas surprisingly hard to meet. The surprising difficulty\npresented by a challenge testifies to the presence of a theory\nin the light of which it should be easily met. The theory that\nhuman beings are rational is the source of the trouble:\nObviously, self -deception is not rational.\nAs long as the received opinion was that human beings are\nfoolish, or unreasonable, it was expected that they sho uld\nbehave erratically, deceive themselves, and so on. Clearly, this\ntraditionally received opinion was an unavoidable corollary to\nthe traditionally received religious doctrines of the Western\nworld prior to modern times: The wages of sin are slight and\nmomentary and the cost of sin is eternal damnation; Hence\nnothing is more rational than to behave properly. Yet people\nwill sin (&#34;the flesh is weak&#34;). The prevalence of sin was taken\nby all the traditionally received religious doctrines of the\nWestern world prior to modern times as conclusive evidence of\nhuman irrationality.\nThe situation was taken quite differently by most of the modern\nrationalistic philosophers, the classical rationalists: They\nconsidered the prevalence of sin to be evidence that sinners\nsimply do not believe in eternal damnation. They reasoned\nthus: Rational people act in accord with their beliefs; people do\nnot act in accord with the belief that their actions will lead to\neternal damnation; hence, clearly, they do not believe in\neternal damnation. Moreover, the classical rationalists taught\nthat it is important to hold the right beliefs. To this end, beliefs\nshould be adopted rationally, and then all will be as well as can\nbe expected. Self-deception, however, does not fit the classical\nrationalist prescription: Classical rationalists always viewed it\nas the willful deviation from rational belief. Its prevalence,\nthen, is, or seems to be, a refutation of their theory of rational\nbelief. Hence its centrality for their theory of rationality -- for\nthe theory of rationality presented in the classical rationalist\ntradition (Agassi, 1977, 1991).\nThis last point deserves a slight elaboration. Practically all\nWestern religious traditions and practically all folk wisdom\nconstantly preach the restraint of natural human appetites on\nthe ground of the (false) observation that selfish conduct\nobviously undermines social stability. The classical (Western)\ntradition of rationalist philosophy disagreed with this teaching\nand rejected this observation (as obviously the very opposite of\nthe truth). It declared any desirable restraint better achieved\nby reasonable, self- reliant individuals than by those frightened\nby hell fire and brimstone. Classical rationalists preferred, on\nthe whole, not to prescribe restraint. They did not deny that\nsome restraint is reasonable. Yet they considered particularly\nerroneous the demand to avoid greed and selfishness. The\nreasonable, self- reliant individual, they taught, will practice the\nnecessary self- restraint anyway. The end of rational conduct is\nalways selfish, as action comes to satisfy the natural appetites\nof actors. Hence, the best way to act, the best way to achieve\none's end, is to behave intelligently - - to act as a reasonable\nself- reliant individual (Agassi, 1 986b).\nIn brief, the classical (Western) tradition of rationalist\nphilosophy rejected as too strict the preaching of (Western)\nreligious traditions and folk wisdom for the restraint of natural\nhuman appetites. Its preached reasonable self- reliance, on the\nopposite view that reasonable, self- reliant individuals are\nbetter able to judge how strict their conduct should be.\nRational action is best guided by thought; Hence, the problem\nof rationality is less a question of the choice of a mode of\nconduct and more the question of the choice of the right belief\nto endorse. The problem then can be limited, at least initially,\nto rational belief.\nThe 17th- and 18th-century rationalist philosophers were\nliberals. They learned to argue against the traditional religio u s\nrequirement for strictness, which was based on the observation\nthat the unintended social consequences of selfish action are\nsocially undesirable. The liberal philosophers suggested, on the\ncontrary, that some social conditions ensure that the\nunintend ed social consequences of selfish action are socially\ndesirable. Under such conditions, then, following natural\nappetites, selfish actions will (unintentionally) support social\nstability rather than undermine it. If so, instead of preaching to\ncurb natural human appetites by the threat of hell fire and\nbrimstone and eternal damnation, it is wiser to create\nconditions that will make selfish conduct socially beneficial:\nThe readiness to act selfishly is more reliable than the\nreadiness to curb selfish motives merely out of fear (Gellner,\n1992, 1995, p. 8.)\nInitially, in the 17th and 18th centuries, the theory of\nrationality was prescriptive rather than descriptive. It became\ndescriptive in the 19th and 20th centuries, with the advent of\nmodern social science . It was recognized then that it is well\nworth investigating the facts of the matter, to observe what\nactions some extant ideas bespeak, and how. This created a\nneed to distinguish explicitly between the two kinds of\nrationality: (a) the intellectual ratio nal choice, the choice of\nbeliefs or of opinions to endorse; (b) the practical rational\nchoice, the choice of the right conduct. This distinction is\nbriefly denoted as the choice between rational thought and\nrational action, or that between thought and action. The need\nto make this distinction explicit was first presented in modern\nsociology. It usually goes by the name of Max Weber, one of\nthe acknowledged fathers of that field, who made his studies at\nthe end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th cent uries.\nNow the classical rationalist assumption is that action is guided\nby thought, and rationally this is done as best as possible.\nHence, the problem of rationality can be limited, at least\ninitially, to the problem of rational thought: What opinions\nshould one endorse? What is rational to believe in? What\ncriterion of choice of a belief should one endorse? The best\nsolutions to these questions, the classical rationalists taught,\nwill ensure the best solutions to all problems.\nRationality and Self- reliance\nQuestion: why did the classical rationalists find it so important\nto insist that, by the classical rationalist recipe, all is as well as\ncan be expected?\nAnswer: Because throughout the history of classical\nrationalism, its adherents have opposed the re ligious doctrine\nthat humans are evil and replaced it with the classical\nrationalist gospel of self- reliance as the road to salvation\n(Agassi, 1977).\nQuestion: If all is as well as can be expected, why is the world\nstill so frustrating, why are people so d isappointing as they\nare?\nAnswer: Because, says the classical rationalist, people are still\nnot self- reliant.\nQuestion: Why are people not self -reliant? What will make them\nso?\nAnswer: People are not self- reliant, says the classical\nrationalist, because they are captives of the [religious]\ndoctrines which they are taught, which makes them rely on\ntheir teachers. Only giving up these doctrines will enable\npeople to become self-reliant. After the act of giving up\nreceived opinions, beliefs will be as rational as can be expected\n(for more details see Agassi, 1991). The world may still not be\nperfect even when people will be as rational as possible, but it\nwill be as perfect as possible. This is the classical theory of\nrationality: Rational conduct will bring about the best of all\npossible worlds, says the classical rationalist, particularly\nbecause it will advance scientific research, and thus increase\nself-knowledge and self -reliance.\nIt was in this way that self -deception was integrated into the\nbroader system of the modern or classical rationalist\nmovement, or of the Enlightenment movement, or the moderns.\nSelf- deception, they taught, is irrational, and irrationality is\ndue to the absence of self- reliance, and this absence is due to\nlies with which one is ra ised. Members of this movement were\nhardly ever explicit about religion. Few of those who were\nreligiously skeptic dared hint at that fact. It only became\npermissible to refuse to assume the existence of God in the\nearly 19th century, after the demise of t hat movement, and\neven then there was no attack on established religion until the\nmid -19th century. Nevertheless, this much is clear: The\nundercurrent of the gospel of Enlightenment was that of self-\nreliance; the educational system was blamed for teaching ideas\nthat impede it. The education system was, of course, run and\ncarefully monitored largely by the religious establishment. In\nthe civilized world, this monopoly was broken by the French\nand American Revolutions, yet the monitoring of it by the\nreligious establishment still goes on there to this day. However,\nfew will blame the religious establishment for the widespread of\nirrationality.\nThe situation merits careful analysis. The basic classical\nrationalist tenet is this: Self -reliance is the reliance on reason;\ntherefore it is the same as rationality. It follows from this that\nself- reliance, or rationality, is the best guide to life. There is\nno substitute for thinking: Regardless of whether one is\nreligious, it was suggested, one should not rely on any church\nor leader. Some modern rationalist philosophers preached and\nstill preach religious self- reliance, of course (&#34;God helps those\nwho help themselves&#34;). Yet it was this idea that undermined\nthe authority of established churches and leaderships,\nregardless of whether and to what extent this authority was\nhostile to self -reliance.\nThe question then is, what is rationality? It was treated in a\nstandard way within the classical rationalist tradition, and its\ncurrent formulation is as follows. The question is first split into\ntwo: What is rational action? What is rational belief? The\nclassical rationalist tradition took it for granted that people\nalways act in accord with their beliefs; Otherwise they are\ncoerced by others, by the laws of the land, or by the laws of\nnature, and so they do not act freely, and so they do not really\nact. This is the distinction between action and behavior that\nentered the literature. (Behaviorism, accordingly, is the view\nthat people never act in this sense of the word -- tha t they are\nalways coerced to move as they do by the combination of the\ngeneral laws of nature and specific circumstances. The standard\nclassical rationalist view rejects this doctrine and takes for\ngranted as a fact the repeated observation that people do act.)\nAssuming, then, that people act, it follows that they act\nrationally. It then follows that if their beliefs are rationally\nheld, then their conduct is as good as can be reasonably\nexpected. This seems reasonable, and even commonsense. It is\ncommonsense, of course, only on the supposition that humans\nare naturally rational and self- reliant, that irrational conduct is\ndue to childhood indoctrination in unreasonable beliefs, and\nthat this indoctrination can be overcome for the asking. This\nmeans that peo ple are rational unless they are deceived. Why,\nthen, do people insist on being deceived? Why are people\ngullible? Classical rationalism offers no answer. This is the big\ngap in the classical rationalism of the Enlightenment\nmovement. This doctrine is still very popular, and so the gap is\nstill conspicuous.\nThus, the prevalence of self- deception is the major refutation\nto the doctrine of natural human rationality which is at the root\nof the doctrine of the Enlightenment movement. Moreover, all\ndeception is due to the fact that some of it is successful, and\nsuccessful deception is possible only because many people\nallow themselves to be deceived. Why do they? Because they\ndeceive themselves about other people's credibility. Admittedly,\nsince rational opinio n is at times erroneous, one may be\ndeceived without self-deception. Yet, since reason is the best\nguide, if the rationalist philosophy is true, it will prevent\nconstant systematic error. Systematic error is the result of\ninsistence on it, of the mistrust of reason, and so it is due to\nself-deception. Even the trust in the teaching and\nindoctrination during childhood is a form of self -deception. It is\npossible and rationally obligatory to give it up and be set free.\nYet people often cling to their education. They deceive\nthemselves to trust it. The question that classical rationalism\nhas to answer is, why then do people allow others to deceive\nthem systematically? According to classical rationalism, what\nprevents bridging the gulf between the best, which is the life of\nreason, and the real, which is the practice of systematic error,\nis self- deception alone. This phenomenon deserves special\nattention: It is any systematic error that cannot be viewed as\nanything other than self- deception: All effort to correct it are\nmet with unintelligent excuses.\nError and Sin\nThe ethics of the Enlightenment movement, of the modern\nphilosophy of life, is simple: &#34;Reason is and ought only to be,\nthe slave of the passions&#34;, as David Hume has aptly put it\n(Hume, 1980, Bk. 2, Pt. 3, Sec. 3). On this view, self- interest\nis the only right motive force for action, provided it employs\nreason to the full, which, of course, is eminently reasonable.\nHence, all sin is violation of self -interest, and so, at bottom, all\nsin is error. This is the doctrine of enlightened self-interest. It\nis scarcely new. In antiquity it was known as the Socratic\ndoctrine of eudaimony ('eu' is good and 'daimon' is spirit; the\nname refers to the story, narrated in Plato's The Apology of\nSocrates -- Socrates explains that he is the wisest by reporting\nthat he has a good Fairy Godmother who prevents him from\ndoing what he does not want to do, which is not good for him).\nThis doctrine is particularly hard to defend, since experience is\nmore in accord with the opposite doctrine, according to which\nhumans are both wicked and self-destructive. Thus, the moral\ndoctrine of classical rationalism appears to be empirically\nrefuted.\nThe rejoinder to this criticism comes in two steps. The first\nmove is to reduce all self -des truction to self -deception -- on\nthe supposition that as self -destruction hurts oneself, it is\nnever desirable and so it is never reasonably desired. (It is\nunnatural.) The second move is to reduce wickedness to self -\ndestruction. The way to effect this last reduction is to show\nthat the wicked are sawing the branch on which they sit. This is\nshown by the claim that, as their need for friends requires they\nshould be benevolent not wicked. This is unsatisfactory, as it\nmay work for friends, perhaps even for p otential friends too,\nbut not ever for enemies. It looks eminently reasonable to be\nvicious to them. Then different arguments are marshaled. An\nappeal is made to providence: It is in one's best interest to be\non good terms with divine powers. This, too, is unsatisfactory,\nas it is an appeal to the wishes of the divine, not to those of a\nself- reliant actor. The holders of the monopoly on divine\npowers always oppose self- reliance. An appeal may then be\nmade to one's need for peace of mind, and hence for peace\nwith one's conscience (he conclusion of Hume, 1980, explains\nmartyrdom this way). This, too, is unsatisfactory: Conscience is\nbased on religion, and the exercise of eudaimony was initially\nintended to do away with it, and for good reasons: Clearly, it is\nnot conscience, but the sense of guilt, that disturbs the peace\nof mind. This sense of guilt is forcibly established by religious\neducation to undermine self- reliance. All advocates of self-\nreliance recommend that the sense of guilt be eradicated\n(Kaufmann , 1973; Agassi &amp; Agassi, 1985).\nIt is still possible to defend the doctrine of eudaimony, or\nenlightened self- interest: Self -destructive action is prevented\nby the sufficiently clear understanding of its consequences. The\nstandard contemporary example is smoking, but any bad habit\nwill do. The victims of a bad habit know that their conduct is\nnot in their self- interest, but only in a vague manner: They\noften refuse to see it clearly until their physician convinces\nthem that they are killing themselves. Then many of these\npeople find themselves freed of their bad habit with no effort at\nall. Hence, the intensified energy and sense of guilt invested in\nefforts to stop a bad habit are forms of self -deception: What is\nneeded is not effort nor strong will, but clear understanding of\nthe harm it causes, say the sages of the Enlightenment.\nAs it happens, all this is neither here nor there. Whatever the\nrule is for right behavior, it is clear that self-deception is not\nthe right mode of conduct, yet it is prevale nt. Even the\nassumption that all wickedness is due to self-deception does\nnot help vindicate humanity very much, since self- deception is\nevidently wicked: The pure at heart will hardly fall for it.\n(Others are guilty of the sin of pride.) Hence, regardless of\nwhether one should be as fully self- reliant as possible, and\nwhether the canons of right conduct are those of enlightened\nself- interest, self-deception is both erroneous and sinful, yet it\nis regularly practiced. Why? In particular, is it the sin of it that\nbrings about the error, or is it the other way around?\nBefore we proceed, we may wish to know, what does it matter?\nImperfection is a familiar fact, as are both wickedness and\nstupidity. Why does the old party insist that all impropriety is\nsin, an d why does the new party insist that all sin is error? Why\nnot lump them together, or say that impropriety and\nmisconduct are at times due to error and at other times due to\nsin (and often due to both)? After all, criminal law says exactly\nthis: Criminal c ourts are often called to adjudicate and decide\nabout the reason for some misdeed - - is it due to sin or to\nerror? Moreover, such courts also distinguish between\npermissible and impermissible error. (This is the root difference\nbetween murder, premeditated or not, and involuntary\nmanslaughter or accidental killing.) Why insist on reducing\nerror to sin or the other way around?\nThe answer is this: Suppose that behind every sin lurks some\nerror. The way to reduce sin is then not by preaching, but by\nenlighte ning. This is the explanation that historically stood\nbehind the Enlightenment movement's optimistic view of\nhumanity: Sinfulness is allegedly a part of human nature,\nwhereas ignorance certainly is not. But this is questionable:\nJust as one may say that be hind every sin is error, one may\nalso say that behind every error is sin. Ignorance leads to\nexcusable error only, whereas the error of people's ways are\ndeviations from the straight and narrow. Established religion\ncomes to prevent sin, and it teaches the true doctrine, but\npeople who are wicked will not listen. Thus, according to all\nestablishments that issue rules of proper conduct, self-reliance\nis the cardinal sin. (Hence, science can have no such\nestablishment! This is conspicuously false, yet in the Age of\nReason, in the time when classical rationalism flourished, it\nwas much more reasonable than it is today to assume that\nscience has no establishment whatsoever.) Here, again, we\nmeet the source of the disagreement: It is this question --\nwhat is bett er to rely on, individual self- reliance or traditional\nwisdom?\nThis does not solve the problem at all. The fact remains that\nboth morality and science are cultivated. Why try to eliminate\none of these? The answer is that one depends on the other:\nWisdom, says established religion, begins with the purity of\nheart (&#34;the beginning of wisdom is the fear of God&#34;); ethics,\nretort the enlightened, begins with the intelligent employment\nof reason. Does this dispute matter? Should it not be ignored\nand both morality and reason be employed?\nAll this will still not do. This discussion is stuck with the\nproblematic phenomenon of self -deception; it is admittedly\nboth stupid and wicked; It is better eradicated, but no one\nknows how. Even the combined use of both expla ining and\npreaching does not overcome it, and so there is a genuine need\nto learn more about it so as to cure it. The two common\ntheories identify it as a sin as well as an error, yet they differ\nas to which one is the source of the other. Which is it then? In\nthe hope of finding a better cure, a better understanding of\nself-deception may be sought. In this search, attempts may be\nmade to criticize both theories.\nBacon's Doctrine of Prejudice\nThe present discussion has got into a loop as sin and error are\nreducible to one another: Even if all error/sin is sin/error, it\nseems that the very disposition to err/sin lies in our\nmoral/intellectual imperfection. All humans are disposed to\nboth sin and error, and it is hard to decide which of the two\ndispositions lies deeper. Moreover, as this discussion concerns\nself-deception, it is important to note possibly self -deception is\ninexplicable even were it known if error is the cause of sin or\nvice versa. The curious historical fact is that the presentation\nof the problem was first forcefully made by Sir Francis Bacon,\naround the year 1600. He solved it not by any attempt to\nchoose between blaming sin for error and blaming error for sin\nbut by blaming self-deception for both. He was not concerned\nwith the question, which comes first, sin or error? He was not\nconcerned with social and political philosophy. He had a\ntremendous vision: A great scientific revolution is in the offing,\nand it will bring about a great technological revolution. He was\nconvinced that most social and political problems would be\nsolved by the technological revolution. Until then, he\nrecommended, a conservative attitude to politics should\nprevail.\nAs Bacon was convinced that technology would be\nrevolutionized by the development of scientific knowle dge\nproper, his sole concern in most of his writings was to help the\nadvancement of learning (for a detailed discussion of all this,\nsee Agassi, 1988b). Bacon took for granted the ancient doctrine\nof how enlightenment comes about: The pure mind is prepared\nto perceive the truth in an intuitive experience of sorts. This\ndoctrine is generally known all over the world as mysticism\n(see Agassi, 1981b, Chapter 23). There is much confusion here:\nThe mystics proper do not claim that their knowledge is given\nto cle ar articulation, yet the Platonic and Aristotelian theories\nof learning do. Hence, these theories are not quite mystical;\nthe neo -Platonic or cabalistic doctrines are mystical. The\ncentral question that this raises is, how is the mind purified? It\nengaged Bacon as it engaged many others before and after\nhim. (Different mystics have offered different rituals for this\npurpose.) Everybody agrees, of course, that, to that end, the\nmind has to be of a righteous man -- free of error. The\nquestion remains, how is the mind of cleansed of its errors?\nBoth Plato and Aristotle recommended critical debate as the\nmeans to that end. (Aristotle called this method 'epagoge', and\nthis word was translated into 'induction'.) It is the method of\nquestioning that ends up with de finitions, said Aristotle, as\ninvented by the Pythagoreans and perfected by Socrates and\nPlato. Definitions are the foundations of science, Aristotle\nadded, and they constitute the source of all true knowledge.\nBacon agreed about all of this except for the ancient view of\nthe efficacy of critical debate.\nCritical debates, said Bacon, have gone on in universities for\ncenturies, yet to no avail: Each party sticks to its guns. The\nreason is simple: One can always ignore criticism, or dismiss it\nwith a wittic ism (&#34;this is an exception that proves the rule&#34;),\nor, if one is obliged to take account of it, one can make a new\nsubtle distinction, to make a small exception, or otherwise\nbelittle the worth of an argument.\nThis raises two central questions. First, is it always possible to\nbelittle criticism? Second, why should one do that? The answer\nto the first question is in the affirmative. It is a powerful part\nof logic, known today as the Duhem-Quine thesis. Exceptions\ncan always be classified in a different category. (To take a\ncommon example, the prejudiced who recommend the\ndiscrimination of any sort of people may admit that an instance\nof the sort in question is unjust; they will then place these\ncounterinstances in a separate class and cling to their prejudic e\nagainst the remaining members of the discriminated sort. For\nmore details about the Duhem-Quine thesis see Agassi, 1994.)\nThere are different attitudes to criticism. Duhem said science\nmust accept criticism only in small doses so as to maintain its\nco ntinuity. Why should science do that? Duhem did not explain,\nbut the truth is that he was defending the same medieval\nmethod that Bacon was attacking because he greatly respected\nthe same medieval thinkers Bacon despised. Bacon declared\nthem enemies of pro gress; Duhem declared their contributions\nessential to the history of science. Bacon denied the very\nexistence of mediaeval science; Duhem was its first great\nhistorian. More important, Bacon agreed with the ancient\nrevered philosophers that total scientif ic knowledge of the\nwhole universe is possible; Duhem did not. Bacon declared the\nneed for one and only one scientific revolution -- the one that\neradicates all prejudice and all error; Duhem advocated\ncontinuity and denied the possibility of scientific re volutions.\nBacon envisaged a tremendous explosion of science; Duhem\ntaught that science proceeds in small steps. Bacon ignored\nmathematics altogether and recommended for the mind free of\nprejudice to collect as many and diverse observations of simple\nfacts as possible, and to proceed slowly and carefully towards\nthe goal of total scientific knowledge; Duhem saw this as naive\nand insisted on the need to develop the mathematical\napparatus that is essential for scientific knowledge and fitting\nthe facts within it.\nHow is one to judge between these views? Probably most\npeople will reject both, at least because at least two scientific\nrevolutions have occurred, contrary to both. Bacon was too\nradical in his demand to clean the slate with no theory left and\nDuhe m was too conservative in his claim that science suffers no\nrevolution as each stage of it depends on a previous stage\n(Agassi, 1957, 1963, 1981b. See also the biography of Duhem,\nJaki, 1984).\nBacon was a Utopian visionary in the style of his time -- the\nearly 17th century. He based his vision on a new idea: He\nassumed that the rejection of all preconceived opinions and the\naccumulation of a vast collection of items of factual information\nwill lead rapidly to the full growth of theoretical science.\nFurthe r, he was deeply convinced that this growth will bring\nsalvation, and that salvation is around the corner because\neveryone is naturally disposed to contribute to the growth of\nknowledge (Bacon, 1994, Bk. I, Aphorisms 15 -18). Why, then,\nis salvation not here already? Because there is a small obstacle\nto it: The sins of laziness and pride. People offer conjectures\ninstead of working hard in the search for the truth, and then\nthey refuse to admit criticism as it puts them to shame. Thus,\nthe demand for the purity of mind includes the demand for\ndevotion and humility, caution and resistance to the temptation\nto conjecture. Once one has made a conjecture, one sees the\nworld as conforming to it, is then bound to endorse it as true,\nand is then trapped in it: It be comes a fixed feature of one's\nintellectual makeup. (This is corroborated by contemporary\ncognitive theory: One who endorses the theory that all is x, say\ncognitive psychologists, sees x everywhere; x can be atoms,\nlife, sex, selfishness, or anything else.)\nPrejudging matters instead of letting facts speak for\nthemselves, Bacon explained, is the acceptance of a bribe. His\nexplanation is subtle, and reminds one of what the Bible says\nof it (Exodus, 23:8): Bribery blinds the wise. That is, one says\nto onese lf that one is wise enough not to be blinded by the\nbribe, but to no avail. The very bribe, argued Bacon, is what\nblinds one to the truth, as it is the flattery to oneself. It is only\nself-deception that stands between humanity and salvation\nthrough science. People flatter themselves that they are\ncleverer and more knowledgeable than they are, thus getting\nblind to criticism. Moreover, the psychology of perception as\nfirst offered by Bacon, and as still taught today, suggests that\nnothing can be done about it. To become a good researcher,\nsaid Bacon, one must humbly admit ignorance, and relinquish\nall the preconceived notions that one happens to have; only\nthen, he said, will one qualify to seek knowledge, and even\nthen this holds as long as one does not pro nounce opinions.\nBacon's idea is generally rejected nowadays. It is generally\nagreed that people cannot live with empty heads. (Only some\ndevotees of popular cheap versions of Oriental mysticism\nendorse the false view that some techniques empty the head of\nall ideas.)\nThe observation that theory blinds one to facts that offer\ncriticism of it is a central part of contemporary psychology of\nperception and cognition. It often goes today by the name of\nthe 20th -century psychologist Leon Festinger. This observ ation\nhas led some thinkers, such as Giordano Bruno and Galileo\nGalilei of the 16th and 17th century, to the obvious conclusion\nthat such observations spuriously validate the theories that\ninvoke them. Bacon agreed but claimed that a theory can be\nproperly validated -- when it is rooted in unbiased\nobservations: As long as theory precedes observation, he said,\nits validation by facts is assured for all those who propound it\nand for no other; only if it emerges by itself out of many and\ndiverse observations, he assured his reader, is the result truly\nassured and will convince all. Hence, proper observation begins\nwith the cleaning of the observer's mind, and therefore\nobservers must be humble and attend to small facts, not aspire\nto be the proud originators o f great philosophical systems.\nWhy is the sin of pride so special in the scheme of things? Why\nare all sins to be viewed as errors, yet pride the sin at the root\nof error? Bacon answered that pride too is but error; of course\nit is a form of self -deception. It is the error that is the source\nof all errors, as it inhibits the natural disposition to learn the\ntruth; it perverts the natural order of things by placing theory\nprior to observation, like building a house beginning from the\nroof.\nBacon stressed that the matter is subtle. There was no known\nreason to forbid the making of conjectures before he discovered\nthat conjecture perverts the mind so that it is essential to\nrelinquish all preconceived notions before one can contribute to\nthe advancement of learning. Because the natural disposition to\ndevelop science is stronger than the disposition to make\nconjectures, Antiquity had knowledge and no reason to advance\nany conjecture. Then conjectures were advanced, especially\nthose of Aristotle, and they were wicked. Once knowledge was\nperverted, it could not be restored without Bacon's new cure --\nhis prescription of cleaning the slate and proceeding with\ncaution. Naturally until then self -deception was the rule.\nAccordingly, Bacon called his philosophy &#34;The Great\nInstauration&#34;, meaning the return to the golden age of\nAntiquity.\nA Short History of Self- Deception\nSelf- deception, to repeat, is ubiquitous, as is the folk literature\nabout it. Also, folk literature presents self -deception as self-\nflattery. This is a point that Bacon's doctrine makes central.\nBacon's proposal of a remedy had an old component and a new\none. The old component is the following advice: Do not be\ngullible, trust no one but the facts and your own reason. The\nnew component is; Discard all earlier opinions and start afresh.\nThis is Baconian radicalism, and this is what characterizes\nmodern, classical rationalist philosophy. Its most specific\ncharacteristic is its being Crusonian, as Popper and Gellner\nhave called it (Popper, 1945, vol. 2, pp. 219-20, 215; Gellner,\n1995, p. 7; see also Agassi, 1981b, pp. 477-85, 488). As\nDescartes found out, after cleaning one's slate and before\ndeveloping one's own philosophy, one is utterly alone. In the\n19th century Descartes' philosophy and his venture, the\nBaconian venture of starting afresh, were not as popular as in\nearlier centuries. One of its opponents was Kierkegaard (1985,\nPreface), who nevertheless admired Descartes for having the\ncourage needed for this venture. As this venture was deemed\ncentral to modern, classical rationalism, understandably,\nrejecting it led many, Kierkegaard included, to reject\nrationalism itself.\nThe reason that self -deception is the single obstacle, and such\na formidable one at that, is simple. Almost any obstacles that\nmay lie on the way of a self- reliant individual may be handled\nin the best manner available. The only insurmountable obstacle\nto self -reliance is self -deception, since its victims are unaware\nof its very presence. Classical rationalists deemed the Baconian\nventure of cleaning the slate indispensable because it is easy to\ndeceive oneself: As long as one holds to any opinion, to any\nopinion whatsoever, one is too well disposed toward it. Hence,\nthose who rejected Bacon's radicalism were disposed to the\nview that self -deception is unavoidable. After Bacon had\ngranted prominence and significance to the disposition for self -\ndeception as the chief obstacle to the advancement of learning,\nand so to advancement in general, it became clear that the\ndisposition to be rational depends on the single condition that\nself-deception be avoided. The irrationalists then centered, as\nthey still do, on this question: Can this single condition ever be\nmet? Irrationalism is the correct denial of the possibility of\navoiding all self- deception and the erroneous conclusion that it\nis better to rely on tradition, the leadership or one's gut -\nfeelings than on oneself.\n(Bacon's radicalism is not new: It is cabalistic in origin. Why\ndid the performance of the cabalistic ritual fail to bring\nsalvation? Because there is a catch here: To be valid, the ritual\nshould be perform by a deserving individual, and that individual\nmust be humble. But it is hard to be humble when one brings\nsalvation to the world. Why do people end up in hell if they\nmay repent even at the gates of hell? Because the wicked are\nhaughty, and, at the gate of hell, they deceive themselves that\nthey are there not deservedly, but out of good will - - out of the\nwill to save its inmates.)\nThe advocacy of self-reliance look as if it were identical to the\nadvocacy of rationality, and either looks as if it were identical\nto the advocacy of the avoidance of self- deception. The\nopposite of self-reliance is the reliance on others, who are not\nreliable, since there is nothing to rely o n except one's own\nreason. Hence, the reliance on others is being deceived and all\ndeception is self -deception at heart. According to Bacon, the\ntransition from reliance on others to self -reliance takes effort,\ncourage, and much good will. This is particularly so because,\nwe remember, according to Bacon, self -reliance begins with the\ncleaning of one's slate -- with starting afresh. This, as\nKierkegaard stressed, is rather frightening. It also leaves too\nmany questions unanswered, such as, what should one do in\nmatters pertaining to one's means of livelihood and of one's\nreligion? These questions were hardly ever dealt with.\nDescartes reported that he would not embark on the project of\ncleaning his slate before he had answered them to his own\nsatisfaction. To day, almost all students of this matter agree\nthat these questions were hardly ever dealt with, and they can\nnever be satisfactorily answered.\nThis is a significant point. Children have faith in a Santa Claus\nof one sort or another, and in their having m others. Somehow\nthe faith in Santa Claus fades away, but having mothers is\nnever questioned. (Feminists have a point, then, when they say\nthere could never have been a female Descartes.) The demand\nthat one should doubt even the existence of one's body, then,\nis only understandable in the sense that the extant scientific\ntheories of bodies should be doubted. Indeed, the idealists who\ndenied the existence of matter did not question the\ncommonsense view of matter and of their own having emerged\nout of their mothers' wombs. They questioned the theory of\nmatter propounded by Descartes, by Newton, or by other\nphysicists. It is no accident that the Baconian program and its\nexecution by Descartes concerned the improvement of the\nnatural sciences and technologies, hardly the improvement of\nthe social sciences (or the moral sciences, to use the\nantiquated terminology), and even less so the social and\npolitical technologies. The application of the Baconian program\nto social and political studies came later, as an afterthought,\nand its application to political affairs was unexpected and\nbizarre.\nThe Baconian project -- his plan to develop science - - was a\ngreat success, as was his idea that technology will develop\nmagnificently on scientific foundations. His view was e choed by\nhis followers John Locke, David Hume, and, above all, Adam\nSmith (Hal\xe9vy, 1955, p. 433). During the French Revolution it\nwas echoed by Condorcet (1976; see also Schapiro, 1934). It\nwas the faith that scientific -technological progress will\ninevitably improve social matters without much ado. This\nBaconian aspiration -- to save humanity through the\nadvancement of science and technology -- failed totally,\nalthough not before it landed humanity in the modern world --\nindustrial, post-industrial, and developing -- for better or\nworse.\nThe first great fiasco of the Baconian program to save humanity\nthrough the advancement of science and technology was the\nFrench Revolution. The idea is not new that the revolution was\nthe daughter of the ideas of the Enlightenment movement,\nespecially its radicalism. This idea was advanced by the leading\nReactionary thinkers, Edmund Burke and Georg Wilhelm\nFriedrich Hegel (see Agassi, 1977, pp. 218 -20). They did not\nsay it out right, but their followers did: People want to b e\ndeceived. They want that because they cannot practice self -\nreliance. This Reactionary idea helped the tyrants of the\nmodern, developed world immensely, and caused untold harm.\nThe Reaction had much less of a vision and no program, yet\nbeing conservative it could always fall back on tradition. The\ncentral idea of the Reaction, then, was that people need\ntradition to tell them what to believe in. This takes the central\nidea of the Reaction out of the present discourse. The Reaction\nmade a concession to the Enlightenment movement: Some\nindividuals can be self -reliant. They prove it by going into the\ndesert and staying there without food, drink, or company for\nforty days and forty nights. The Reaction deprived even the few\nself- reliant individuals of their reason: They are exceptional\nbecause they are extremely ambitious, and they follow their\nown bent no matter what. This is a recommendation for self-\ndeception on a grand scale. It suggests that the exceptional\nmust be lonely and stubborn, which is what cha racterizes many\npsychopathological cases. Indeed, Hegel said there is no way to\ndistinguish between the exceptional who is a genius from the\none who is crazy, or alienated, to use the term of Pinel: To be\njudged alienated (by accepted norms) is the price for one's\ndecision to be self -reliant (until one manages to alter the\nnorms and then be declared a hero). The Reactionary doctrine\nof dependence and self - reliance is a gross exaggeration. Let us\nreturn to a more commonsensical version of rationalism\n(Agassi, 1981b, Chapter 15.)\nExtreme Rationalism as Self- Deception\nNo rule of logic is more potent than that which proscribes\ncontradictions: They are deadly. Not only are they\ndemonstrably false; declaring one true is the denial of all error,\nand so it is the admission of every possible statement.\nNevertheless, a mathematical text can all too easily include\none. In mathematics a misprint may introduce an error, and\nintroducing an error into a mathematical system usually\namounts to adding a contradiction to it (the equation 1 + 2 = 3\nbecomes a contradiction when any one item in it is misprinted).\nStrictly, the rule banning all contradictions renders all texts\nthat contain such misprints worthless. However, it is often easy\nto eliminate misprints by simply overlooking them, and this is\ndone heedlessly unless and until they cause trouble. Even\nresearchers whose ideas seem inconsistent are known to\nproceed working without worry about inconsistency, in the hope\nthat this matter will be taken care of later. It is hard to judge\nhow rational this attitude is; in the oversight of inconsistency,\none risks the waste of time in the study of a worthless system.\nIf the system under study happens to be consistent, or if the\ninconsistency in it is easy to remove, the result of the study\nmay be useful. However, often a researcher investing much\nefforts in some interesting question will obtain exciting results\nthat rest on an inconsistency, so that the invested labor was\nsheer waste.\nHere is an interesting corollary to the theory of self-deception.\nIt is one thing to take a calculated risk, regardless of whether\nthe end result is happy. It is quite another thing to pretend to\nhave taken a calculated risk, be optimistic about matters, and\nforge ahead carelessly. Often the investment o f effort is only of\nsome pleasant hours of research that one may easily afford to\nlose. It is an observed fact that if stakes are high and the\nresearcher is highly strung, self -deception steps in as the\nrefusal to entertain the merest possibility of an error. It is hard\nto differentiate the reasonable cases of calculated risk from the\ncases of carelessness, as there is no theory that tells us when\nthe risk is great and when not. Perhaps there can be no such\ntheory regarding research.\nSo much for the requirement for consistency. It is more\ndifficult to study other requirements, as these may be\nabandoned. This is the case with demonstrability - - the super-\ncriterion traditionally most generally adhered to and rightly\nmost respected. It is invalid; adherence to it causes confusion\nand self -deception. Without the assumption that philosophers\naddicted to it are deluding themselves, it is hard to explain its\npopularity, despite its great allure. Historically, it is a central\nidea, and yet today it is recognized as most baffling. What is\ndemonstrability? What theory of it is there? As its natural place\nis in mathematics, it can be examined there first.\nThe standard examples of demonstrations -- of proofs -- are\nmathematical, especially those of Euclid and of Archimedes. By\nmodern standards, the quality of these demonstrations is very\nlow. Russell (1917, pp. 66, 94-50) said that Euclid's proofs\nscarcely qualify. The first to have offered reasonable proofs,\nsaid Russell, was George Boole, at the mid -19th century (p.\n74). In classical geometry, proofs consisted of deductions from\nthe axioms of geometry. What follows from a theorem is a\ntheorem, yet two nagging questions remained unanswered.\nFirst, what makes the axioms theorems? Answer: Axioms are\nself-evident: it is impossible to question their truth. Yet at\nleast one axiom of Euclid was always questioned (for each\nstraight line no more than one parallel line goes through a\ngiven point). In the 19th century, a system of geometry was\nconstructed in which that axiom was relinquished. Early in the\n20th century, Einstein developed a theory of gravity whose\ngeometry is non-Euclidean. (It denies that space is the same\neverywhere, as it assumes that the properties of space differ\nwhere gravity differs.) So much for the self-ev idence of axioms.\nThe other question is, how is proof possible without axioms? It\nhas to do with the theorems in the fields of arithmetic and of\nalgebra. These were not based on axioms until early in the 20th\ncentury.\nSo much for proofs. As to proof theo ry, it was developed in the\n1930s by combined efforts of a few great logicians. Their work\nwas clouded by confusions, most of which were cleared decades\nlater. Perhaps even now, proof theory is too problematic, so\nthat perhaps we are still not entitled to claim possession of a\nclear proof theory, not even in logic and mathematics.\nYet the puzzling fact is that classical rationalist philosophy\nrested on the idea that rationality equals proof. An example of\nthe magnitude of the puzzlement may be useful, especially as it\nprovides the flavor of the feeling that accompanies the\nsituation. The classical and most popular work of Wittgenstein\n(1922, Preface and famous last sentence) is accompanied by an\nair of tremendous tension: It declares that, on the one hand,\nwhat it says is so obvious that its articulation is neither\npossible nor called for, and on the other hand it is so difficult\nthat it is beyond words. Much controversy rages as to how to\nread his text, and much of it revolves around the question of\nproof and provability, and of what exactly the message about it\nis. Possibly, however, the literature in question is a mere\nexpression of a tremendous sense of frustration at the inability\nof commentators to face their own inability to prove, which is\nto say tha t the literature in question is a mere exercise in the\nfutility of self-deception.\nAs proof theory developed, it was proved that all effective\nproof procedures are limited, even in mathematics, let alone\nelsewhere, were proof elsewhere at all possible. T he proof --\nG\xf6del's celebrated proof -- was rejected by Wittgenstein. In the\nmeantime, the matter has developed much further, and proof\nprocedures and their limitations have become a field of\nintensive study within computer science. What is not provable\nin one system may be provable in another, as it can be added\nas an axiom; but their addition will create other unprovable\ntheorems. Contrary to Wittgenstein, there is no comprehensive\nsystem in which the logical status of all that can be said is\ndecided once and for all.\nThe idea that rationality equals proof is most basic. It is the\nsource of much strength, but also of much self-deception --\nwithin philosophy as well as within science. Bacon,\nWittgenstein, and many others said, when in doubt one should\nrefrain from endorsing any opinion, one should suspend\njudgment, and one should never express any opinion about\nwhat is doubtful, particularly not in public. Otherwise, self-\ndeception is inevitable. This idea, hostile to self-deception as it\nis, looks immune to it. The fear that it is itself the malady it\ncomes to cure is as frightening as the idea that physicians\ncause death. The fear that the medicine is worse than the ills it\ncomes to cure produces a feeling of helplessness, and that\nfeeling is a tremendous incentive for self -deception. Indeed,\nthis is what happened when Semmelweis brought crucial\nempirical evidence to support the claim that physicians kill\npatients by not washing their hands. For decades his view and\nhis prescription were rejected by his peers. This is a clear case\nof a dangerous, irresponsible, grand -scale self-deception,\npracticed by a scientifically oriented group.\nHowever erroneous classical rationalism is, it is still very\npopular among philosophers who like it for its advocacy of the\nuse of reason and its support of science and of self -reliance.\nYet it is itself a case of self-deception. These days, the rule of\nscience is tacitly identified as the acceptance of the expert's\nauthority. This is very disconcerting, as any acceptance of any\nauthority is, as it conflicts with the demand for self- reliance. It\nis also silly. It is well known that the acceptance of the expert's\nauthority may be fatal (see last paragraph for an example). The\nstandard answer to this trite observation is that the reliance on\nexperts is unavoidable in the modern world. Even it were\nunavoidable, this does not make it less fatal. Moreover, the\nunavoidability of the reliance on experts has nothing particular\nto do with the modern world: It has always been the case, an d\nit is much less so today, when the educated citizen knows more\nmedicine than the best physician of a century ago. As the\nhypothesis that there is no choice but to rely on experts is\nrefuted, it may be replaced with increasingly better hypotheses\nthat wil l say how far and under which conditions the reliance on\nthe experts' authority is worse than doing altogether without\nthem. The reliance on experts' authority is clearly the worst\nsuperstition of the allegedly rationalist and the allegedly\nscientifically inclined, and this includes most research scientists\naround (Feyerabend, 1970).\nSelf- Deception as Fixation\nBacon's doctrine of prejudice was limited to the prejudices of\nthe researchers. Marx extended it to the views -- the prejudices\n-- extant in the gene ral population, especially the extant\nphilosophy of life. He labeled it 'ideology'. Following Hegel he\ndenied the universalism of the Enlightenment movement, and\nreplaced it with the view that the parochial views are locally\nvalid. (Hegel called the views and attitudes agreeable to the\nstate 'the Universal'.) This theory is known as relativism or,\nmore specifically, epistemic and moral relativism (see Agassi,\n1992). Every period of history, Hegel said, has its own truths,\nas created by the heroes who are the leading lights of that\nperiod. These heroes together constitute the group of\nindividuals who count -- &#34;the World Historical Figures.&#34; Marx\naccepted Hegel's epistemic and moral relativism only for the\npast -- for class society. He declared the truth in a class\nsociety to be socially determined, but he taught that, in\nclassless society, the truly universal would prevail. Hence, in a\nclass society all truths are relative and socially determined.\nHence, all ideology is class prejudice. Being prejudices,\nideologies are hard to shake off. This can only be done by\nindividuals who can peer into the mechanisms of history, like\nMarx himself -- they can divine the future society and the\ntruths of that society.\nAccording to Marx the society of his day was ruled by\nemployers, by the capitalists. He predicted that the ruling class\nof his day were destined to be replaced by employees, by the\nworkers. He viewed other philosophers as captives of capitalist\nprejudices. He viewed himself as the mouthpiece of the future\nsociety. He viewed the prejudices of the capitalists inferior to\nthose of the workers. He therefore held the view that the views\nhe was holding were superior to those held by other\nphilosophers.\nThis is Hegelian: The top representative of humanity, be it the\ntop nation (Hegel), top class (Marx), top civilization or culture\n(Spengler, Toynbee), or anything else that is tops, is tops in\neach and every respect. Hegel had a simple justification for this\nbizarre idea: The best is the militarily strongest, and the\nstrongest takes all that is of value -- the way Napoleon robbed\nthe countries he conquered of their artwork. Hegel and Marx\nnever explained why the arts and sciences always progress and\nthey disregarded the historical facts of regress. The most\nconspicuous fact that Greek art and science are superior to\nmediaeval art and science was brushed aside with the aid of\nthe claim for the superiority of the mediaeval political system\nor its agricultural technology over its predecessors. This is only\nevidence that being superior in one dimension is no guarantee\nfor superiority in another. This option did not occur to Marx nor\nto Marxist scholars in the middle of the 20th century. (The\nfamous scientist and historian of science J. D. Bernal (1939,\nChapter 2, Section 1) declared flippantly that medieval science\nis superior to Greek science. (See also Bernal, 1952, 1954, p.\n209; Agassi, 1963, Chapter 7 and notes.)\nTraditionally, philosophy was reductionist: It recommended that\nevents that belong to the different human sc iences should be\nexplained by theories from only one human science. Traditional\nreduction was to psychology: All human science, it was\nsuggested, are at heart psychology: Sociology, politics and\neconomics are really parts of psychology. Bacon's doctrine of\nprejudice was perhaps behind this trend. When Hegel reduced\nthe individual to society and declared political history the basic\nhuman science, he declared it essential for sanity to believe in\nnational myths. Marx advocated the reduction of all human\nsciences to economics. He wanted to see all explanation of\nhuman affairs by reference to the economic conditions of the\nsociety in which they occur, chiefly in terms of the\nadvancement of its technology. Freud, however, clung to the\ntraditional recommendation to reduce all human phenomena to\npsychology. He attempted to explain the way some private\nprejudices have a strong hold on the minds of their victims: He\nwas impressed by the fact that neuroses constitute intellectual\nblind spots, especially when the neurotics who sustain them are\nintelligent. He explained this by his theory of the emotional\ntrauma ('trauma' means wound).\nFreud's theory of the emotional trauma is simple. The cause of\nevery neurosis, he suggested, is a trauma caused by some\nfrightening, painful childhood event. Initially, the trauma leads\nto an attempt to cope with it by conjecturing a hypothesis.\nBeing infantile, this hypothesis is not surprisingly of a low\nintellectual level. What is surprising is that the neurotic never\ngets over the init ial hypothesis. This, Freud explained, is due to\ntwo facts. First, reliving the traumatic incident is painful.\nSecond, one attempts to avoid that pain. For example, if one\nconjectures that the pain in question is caused by the rejection\ndue to one's lack o f achievement, one will increase one's\nefforts to achieve. The refutation of the hypothesis will only\nlead to redoubling the effort, rather than to recognizing that no\neffort will reverse the rejection (because one tries to achieve\nthe wrong object, becaus e the rejection is irreversible, because\nthere was no rejection to begin with, or because of anything\nelse). Therefore, the purpose of psychoanalytic treatment\nshould be liberating neurotics from the prejudices that are at\nthe base of their neurotic conduct, which incapacitates them.\nThis, according to Freud, can be achieved only by helping them\nrelive their initial traumatic experiences. Once this is achieved,\npatients experience strong relief and a sense of catharsis, and\nthen, according to Freud, all is well.\nThis is Freud's celebrated catharsis theory. He later claimed to\nhave refuted it to his own satisfaction. It is difficult to say what\nreplaced catharsis as the aim of psychoanalytic treatment after\nthat theory was abandoned. Possibly Freud was too hasty to\nreject the theory; Possibly the fault was not in the ascription of\ntherapeutic power to catharsis, but in the view that, after it,\nthe patient is well and the treatment is over. I (Agassi, 1981a)\nhave suggested that the recovered mental patient ne eds\ntreatment that is usually accorded to the physically\nconvalescent. When a convalescent has weak muscles, it\nmatters little why; the question is, how should they be\nstrengthened? The same may be true of the mentally\nconvalescent, whose decision power is small. If so, what\nprecisely the prejudice was that the catharsis reveals is less\nimportant than the treatment accorded to willing mentally\nconvalescents. This shows that Freud's theory is one of self -\ndeception. It is a model for a number of such theories , yet not\na sufficiently good one, as it does not take into account the\natrophy of self -reliance due to prolonged neurosis. Freud has\nrightly observed that adolescents often get rid of their\nprejudices, but not those acquired under severe traumas --\ninclud ing morality, which is thus inculcated under the\nconditions of brainwashing, said Feyerabend (1968).\nSelf- deception can be treated in all generality. It is rational to\ninquire, to seek the truth, but perhaps not at any cost. At\ntimes, the search for the truth is too costly, and its outcome is\nof little significance. In these cases, it is reasonable to give up\nthe quest. This is a troublesome catch. One remains ignorant,\nfirst, of the truth that one allows to remain hidden, and then\nalso of the cost of giv ing it up - - of relinquishing it. More than\nBacon, Freud renders self -deception as the opposite of the\nsearch for the truth. He insisted more on the relentless search\nfor the truth. Yet the limitation on the cost of the search for\nthe truth remains. Select iveness is unavoidable, and one about\nthe search for the truth is inherently blind. What should be\ndone about this? Freud was troubled by interminable analysis,\nwhich is an expression of both the excessive cost of analysis\nand its contribution to the increased atrophy of the patient's\nself- reliance.\nThis is where Freud got stuck. Bacon's doctrine relates to the\nsearch for the scientific truth. He said the search should not be\nselective, because any selection is guided by an idea, and that\nidea is a prejud ice: It is judgment prior to the presentation of\nthe relevant evidence. Even asking specific question, Bacon\nsaid, is selective. The choice of a question is rooted in a\nprejudice. To avoid prejudice, research must be indiscriminate\nand all discovery accide ntal. Freud's view of his own research\nwas orthodox Baconian; his claim that his theory evolved out of\nmyriads of observations was clearly Baconian; his suggestion\nthat analysts intervene minimally in the analytic process of\nself-discovery was based on his fear of prejudice. Yet his\ntheory was related to everyday life, where the question about\nthe search for the truth cannot be as all encompassing as in\nresearch. Thus, he could not say how neuroses-free the\naverage citizen should be (Freud, 1962, third para graph from\nthe end).\nFreud appealed to simple common sense: One often deviates\nfrom the normal healthy views of things, and one is then\nnormally corrected by circumstances or by peers. It is abnormal\nto resist this kind of correction. Abnormal resistance to\ncommon sense is at times intelligent, as in the case of a\nresearch scientist. Alternatively, it is sometimes unintelligent,\nat other times it is hardly a trouble, and still other times it\nincapacitates. This then requires treatment. Here then is the\nplace for Freud's original contribution: The neurotic resistance\nis still rational, although it is obsessive (i.e., pathological). It\nis the insistence of avoiding the pain of reliving the trauma.\nThis is a hurdle the incapacitated should be helped to clear.\nReluctance to discuss one's opinions rationally is the outcome\nof the assessment that discussion will be painful. However, one\nis never able to assess properly the cost of the reluctance to\nacquire information for want of that very information. Therefore\none should always be ready to reassess one's view that the\npain is not worth the benefit. If common sense calls for this\nreassessment and is met with an obsessive refusal, perhaps the\ncause is psychopathological. Otherwise, the resistance is better\ndiagnosed differently, especially when it expresses the fear of\nself- reliance ('decidophobia' is the apt term offered by\nKaufmann, 1973).\nConclusion: The New Theory of Rationality\nThe discussion thus far is couched within common sense or in a\nframework that diffe rs radically from the classical theory of\nrationality. Since Freud fully endorsed that theory, his\ndiscussion was possibly inconsistent -- in that it mixed common\nsense with the classical theory of rationality. Even if it is\nconsistent, it is encumbered with irrelevant difficulties, and in\nits original wording it is much harder to comprehend than its\n(more general) variant reproduced here.\nThe discussion herein also deviates from the classical theory of\nrationality in its avoidance of the theory that the rational is the\nprovable. Nor does it require an explicit wording of an\nalternative theory of rationality. The new theory of rationality\nthat is required should share with common sense the idea that\nthere is no human perfection. It should not assume any pa rt or\naspect of any product of the human mind to be perfect and\nabove error. Briefly, it should include the idea that it is\ndesirable to eliminate error as far as possible; it suggests that\nthis is done by criticism. Criticism, then, should be viewed not\nas hostile, but as help. This idea is not new, and is clearly\nexpressed in Plato's Gorgias. Yet in the writings of Plato (and\nAristotle) the rationality of criticism is presented as a mere\npreliminary to the rationality of proof. Omitting this, we receive\nthe new theory of rationality, or a variant of it: Critical\ndiscussion is not the appetizer but the main course. Hence, it is\nnot just concerning received opinions, as Plato and Aristotle\nsuggested, but an endless process of inventing ever newer\nconjectures and their refutations -- as much as is within the\npowers of the participants in the process Popper, 1945,\n[Agassi, 1995). (This raises the question, is logic perfect, and\nis mathematics? These matters are not discussed here,\nalthough they are of great philosophical interest.)\nThe assumption that criticism is rational is very rational, and\nits rejection by Bacon and his followers is a great pity,\nalthough Bacon was right to observe that critical discussion as\npracticed in the universities was an exercise in futility. The first\nmodern variant of the fallibilist theory of rationality, which\nincorporates the assumption that rationality is critical debate,\nis due to Popper (1945, Chapter 24). His theory is not free of\nobjections, especially Bacon's. Criticism may be pointless at\ntimes. It can also be an unaffordable luxury. It is impossible to\nknow if this applies to the case at hand. The theory under\nconsideration may deserve criticism and it may not: Investing\nin criticism risks wasting valuable time.\nExamp les of irrational critical thinking abound, and at times\nthey can be classified as pathological. Psychotherapists are\nfamiliar with many kinds of them. Patients are often ingenious\nat inventing new excuses that allow them to ignore or belittle\ncriticism of their views and conduct. Patients are likewise\ningenious at inventing criticisms of, and in finding lacunae in,\nthe assumptions behind threatening proposals of therapists.\nPeople often use many tools -- physical or mental -- without\nbothering about their inner mechanisms. When patients are\nafraid of using a proposal made by their therapists, they\nsuddenly show passionate interest in the mechanisms involved\nin the proposal and in critical debates about them. These\npassionate interests are delay tactics and expressions of fear.\nThe observation of Konrad Lorenz is relevant here: Conduct\nunder fear and pressure is less intelligent than the average in\nall animals. The claim made here is that even losing one's mind\nis a process due to rational conduct, but in fea r and under\ngreat stress, and so with an ever-decreasing level of rationality\n(Fried &amp; Agassi, 1976).\nThus, there are levels of rationality; the highest level available\nis hardly ever attained. It is approached only in some very\nleisurely, research -oriented discussions. Even then it is not\nalways clear what avenue is best to take (contrary to classical\nrationalism), as there are many possibilities, some of them\ninherently blind. Thus, it is only seldom clear how the level of\nrationality can be raised. Tha t the rationality of action may be\na matter of degree is common sense, and if all rationality\nshould be seen as a matter of degree, it is useful to view\nrational thought as a variant of rational action. Traditionally,\nrational thought, or rational opinion, was distinguished from\nrational action (including thinking). This is reinforced by the\ntraditional distinction between states (of mind) and (mental)\nprocesses. This distinction is subtle and redundant: Jarvie and I\n(Agassi &amp; Jarvie, 1987) have suggested to v iew thought as a\nkind of action and the theory of rational thought as a part of\nthe theory of rational action. This is meat to be a supplement\nto Popper's theory of rationality.\nThere are two points to mention before bringing this chapter to\na close. First, unlike the classical theory of rationality, the\nfallibilist theory does not split rationality sharply to the\nscientific and the rest. It also recognizes common sense and its\nprogress. (Think of the views of nutrition common a century\nago, which reco mmended what is today viewed as empty\ncalories and/or a cholesterol-rich diet; or of sexuality, which\ndeemed masturbation self-destructive and the pleasure of sex\nundesired by decent women.) It also takes for granted that, in\nscience as elsewhere, every significant criticism is an\ninvention, so that it is important to see the difficulty of being\ncritical (and so of being highly rational). This relates to the\nsecond point. The fear of criticism is rational, but not as\nrational as the effort to overcome it. Self-deception is thus a\nform of rational human conduct, but it is inferior to attempts to\novercome fear and more so to fearless openness. This is not to\nsay that every possible case of self -deception is equally\nharmful and to be equally harshly combated. O ften\npsychotherapists encounter cases that they judge -- hopefully\nrightly - - as not deserving treatment. The cases that do\ndeserve treatment, even at a great cost, Freud noted, are those\nthat grossly interfere with the ordinary course of life. Some\ncases are subtle and difficult to judge. A sense of proportion\nmust prevail in discussing them. The pursuit of the truth is\nlaudable, but it is not necessarily always the required\ntreatment.\nA sense of proportion is indispensable anyway, since there is no\ngreater self -deception than the claim that one is utterly free of\nit, as is regrettably exemplified by the great thinkers Bacon,\nMarx, and Freud. This should be remembered as a warning\nagainst excessive self -confidence: Humans are all fallible and,\nas Plato already observed in great detail, it behooves us to be\ngrateful for any attempt at criticism and correction.\nAppendix\nThe editor has drawn my attention to a very recent essay by\nAlfred R. Mele (Mele, 1996), that deserves notice because it\ncomprises a very comprehensive survey of the most recent\nliterature on self-deception, which is becoming increasingly\nfashionable these days. The literature is written from the\nviewpoint of the theory of rationality as the rational degree of\nbelief and that as the degree to which the belief is justified by\nexperience. This viewpoint was declared in this chapter as a\nversion of self-deception, perhaps also an expression of some\nanxiety. The starting -pint of that literature is the so-called\nparadox of self -deception. Assume that successful deception\noccurs when one who thinks that some statement is true\nconvinces someone else that it is not. Assume further that one\nsuccessfully deceives oneself the same way. As a result, one\ndoes and does not think that the statement in question is true.\nAs was explained here, it is easier to begin with self -deception\nand view most cases of deception as variants of it. As explained\nin this chapter, self-deception is always a form of ambiguity\nand/or confusion and ignorance, so that it is a spectrum, and\nthere is no sharp division between those engaged in it and\nthose who keep clear of it, although some people are very near\nthe one end of the spectrum and others on the other.\nMele reports numerous experiments in self -deception, with no\nregard to th e question, how well trained the subjects of the\nexperiment are in the art of self -criticism. The absence of self-\ncriticism, it was argued in this chapter, is not the same as self-\ndeception, especially since all criticism is the result of some\ncreative act . There is also the question of the cost of self -\ncriticism that the experiments discussed by Mele disregard. The\nexperimenters do not ask, how important is the self-deception\nunder discussion and how important the individuals in question\nconsiders it. Most engagement in astrology by modern educated\npeople is a mild, harmless form of self -deception that cannot\nbe taken as seriously as the case of self -deception that leads to\ndisaster.\nReferences\nAgassi, J.

All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave,\n1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter\nis very complicated. Let me show this now.\nFideism is a minimal retreat from classical rationalism. As this theory is\ncomprehensive in its demand for proof as ultimate justification, it begs the question\nof its own justification. All parties to the current dispute admit that this is a defect\nthat has no cure except by some modification. To that end adherents to fideism\nadvocate some axiom taken on faith as the minimum necessary concession to\nirrationalism. The rationalism that the advocates of fideism qualify is the classical\ntheory of rationality, that is, to be precise, an assertion plus a demand. The theory is,\nrationality equals proof. The demand is to make an assertion \u2013 or to endorse it, to\nbelieve it \u2013 if and only if proof is available that the assertion is true. As the skeptics\nhave shown, any proof of any (synthetic) assertion requires a proof theory that\nrequires proof in its turn. (The possibly of proof in logic and in mathematics has no\nplace in the present discussion.) The skeptics have then recommended holding no\nbelief, making no definite assertion, holding all views only tentatively. Skeptics\nclaim that they have a proof that no proof is possible that should satisfy classical\nrationalists. Most rationalists have invested much effort in attempts to find fault in\nthat proof, and they are still trying. As this essay concerns the dispute between\nPopper and Bartley, who both endorse the skeptic proof, we may take the skeptical\nproof for granted. Hence, the classical theory of rationality cannot stay as it is. The\nadvocates of fideism conclude, then, that some retreat is imperative. The minimal\ndeviation is an assertion that advocates of fideism recommend to endorse without\nproof. That is to say, they recommend its endorsement upon faith. There are two\nstandard candidates for that assertion: the principle of induction and the faith of one\u2019s\nforefathers.\nOf course, not all deviation from the classical theory of rationality is fideist.\nSince advocates of fideism propose that the deviation from the old view should be\nminimal, it is hard to see how this proposal is contestable. An obvious point to\ncontest concerns the question, what deviation is minimal. On this Popper has made a\nbrilliant alternative proposal. Although it has not gained popularity among advocates\nof fideism, it is obviously the best thus far offered. It is this. The least concession\nshould not be the faith in any principle of induction, much less in a given traditional\nfaith, but preferably in the possibility that rational debate may generate progress.\nAdvocates of fideism may object to this obviously superior proposal: it accompanies\na lower standard of rationality. Whereas the classical theory of rationality equates\nrationality with proof, Popper\u2019s theory equates rationality with the critical attitude.\nWhat is preferable, one irrational axiom or this reduction of the standard? The\nanswer is that the reduction of the standard is necessary anyway since the skeptical\ncriticism of traditional rationalism is valid. (Thus, Bertrand Russell advocated the\nadoption of some principle of induction upon faith in the hope that it will suffice to\njustify current science [Russell, 1992, 38]; [Russell, 1996, 313-28]. He did not\nmanage to formulate it explicitly.)\nPopper has proposed two brilliant minimizing moves: of the standard of\nrationality and of the concession to irrationalism. Bartley has shown that there is no\nneed for the two moves, as one will do. This he proved conclusively: reducing the\nstandard of rationality renders a concession unnecessary. It is a shame that Popper\nhas not admitted this, suggesting instead that Bartley just improved the wording of\nwhat he had intended to advocate all along: he denied that he made the mistake that\nBartley had attributed to him. It is likewise a shame that Bartley conflated his valid\ncriticism of Popper with his own alternative to it: only the criticism, not the\nalternative to the criticized theory, is uncontestable. The errors on both sides led to an\nimpasse. In desperation, Bartley called Popper a fideist, and Popper took offence. My\naim here is to rectify these two errors and thus restore the peace between their ghosts.\nNow the fideism that Bartley has saddled Popper with is at the very least not\nthe traditional version but an improvement on it. It says, welcome critical scrutiny as\nprogressive. If this is a version of fideism, then it is an admirable version of it. Both\nPopper and Bartley have confused this idea, be it a version of fideism or not, with a\nslightly greater demand: do not advocate a theory unless it has passed critical\nscrutiny. This version of rationalism, be it fideist or not, both Popper and Bartley\nrejected, and rightly so, despite its superiority over the more traditional versions of\nfideism. Regrettably they did not praise it before rejecting it, although by the canons\nof criticism they should have.\nTaking for granted here the skeptical criticism of traditional rationalism, let us\nconsider the question, which modification of it is right? Considering any proposed\nmodification, why should we adopt it? To take it upon faith has all the defects of\nfideism without its advantage (of being a minimal concession). For the sake of the\nargument, let us agree to prefer the modification that is the smallest concession to\nirrationalism. What is it? And is that preferable to the original fideist view? And\nworse, how are we to adjudicate on this without begging the question? Still worse,\nwhatever answer to this question that we may offer, will it not remain fideist at heart?\nBartley acutely observed that when Popper said that his proposal (to takes the\nfaith in reason on faith) is a deviation from rationalism, he was in error (or at the very\nleast unclear): the deviation is from classical, not from critical rationalism: applied to\nitself, classical rationalism does not live by its own precepts (it begs the question);\napplied to itself, critical rationalism may live by its own precepts, at least possibly so.\nSo far this criticism of Bartley is obviously right, and Popper should have\nacknowledged its validity. Unfortunately this did not happen. Partly it was Popper\u2019s\nfailing, partly it was a confusion that rested on the fact that Bartley had his own view\nof critical rationalism that Popper had all the right to reject \u2013 but not before admitting\nthe validity of Bartley\u2019s criticism.\nFor my own part, I am no party to this dispute [Agassi, 1981, 72, 100, 465-71,\n474, 476]. My aim here is not to take sides but to clarify it and perhaps to remove the\nvery ground for it. I reject the framework within which it takes place. My alternative\nto that framework is the idea that rationalism is a working hypothesis. Thus it is\nneither a basis for rational thought nor an object of faith, but simply an assumption\nthat facilitate rational deliberations. It seems to me that on second thought both\nPopper and Bartley would have agreed. They could object that I have not said what\nrational deliberation is, but here I defer to their own views on it, which are quite\ntraditional and also sufficiently unproblematic to serve as the default option.\nMy effort to neutralize a dispute may sound like an exercise in the tradition of\nlogical positivism. It is not. For, it replaces a metaphysical framework with a better\none, and it does not destroy a problem but replaces it with a better alternative, much\nin the tradition of critical rationalism. Thus, needless to say, I ascribe my alternative\nto Popper and Bartley and take their input as either propaedeutic (preparatory) or the\nlong way around, as you like it.\n1. The hyper-stable working hypothesis\nWhat characterizes a working hypothesis most is its fluidity: there is no commitment\nand hardly any reason to it: its adoption is for a lark. One may even take it on a whim,\nthough on occasion it is common sense. And what one takes on a whim is ephemeral,\nof course. Still, some working hypotheses stay, for good reasons or bad. My concern\nis with a working hypothesis that is hyper-stable. So let me show first that these exist.\nMy claim is that this stability is the most general characteristic of any reasonable\nview of duty. So please be patient.\nWe act voluntarily yet under constraints. Classical liberal thinkers often said,\nin principle there is no difference between free and coerced action. Nevertheless, one\ndifference matters, between keenness and reluctance: we may act reluctantly out of a\nsense of duty. Of course, classical liberal thinkers viewed duty-bound conduct as not\npeculiar, as it is up to us to decide to behave morally, so that we always act\nvoluntarily. Nevertheless, the difference between the fulfillment of one\u2019s own\ninterest and that of others is a matter of principle. This is particularly so in cases of\nacts with unlikely consequences. When we face options that are not likely to yield\nfruits, we tend to adopt choices that are easiest: the game is not worth the candle, we\nmay say to ourselves and quit. Yet when the game is obligatory, this is unacceptable.\nMany moral acts are unlikely to have worthy consequences, yet were that a sufficient\nexcuse for quitting a task allows us to be socially apathetic and even asocial. When it\ncomes to affairs of other people and more so to public affairs, as the duty of hope we\nshould grant the Good Lord the benefit of doubt [Agassi, 1999, 50-4, 124-5]. In our\nown affairs we may be more realistic. Hence, whereas optimism as an opinion is\nfoolish, as an attitude it is just right and often even obligatory.\nThis is a peculiarity of action out of duty as opposed to one out of self-interest,\nand so classical liberal theory is wanting. Its error rested, indeed, on an optimist\nassessment of the outcome of the broad application of rationality: optimist\nassessments prevent the appearance of the difference in attitude that morality\nprescribes between satisfying the personal interests and those of others . World War II\nexposed this optimism as an error. It matters not whether the error was in the\nassessment of the ease with which rationality would be broadly applicable or in the\nassessment of its outcome. What matters is that the optimist assessment of the\noutcome of our actions is no longer the default option, and that it should stay\nnonetheless as an assumption for our actions \u2013 as a stable working hypothesis.\nA dreadful example for this is the conduct of the Jewish leadership, especially\nthe Zionist leadership in the United States of America during the Holocaust. They\nsabotaged efforts to rescue the Jews of Europe [Agassi, 1999, Ch. 15]. Now they say,\nthey knew these efforts were hopeless. This is a mere excuse, not only because\nrecords available now refute this assessment, but also and more so because a priori\nsuch assessments may be false. Still, admittedly, at the time the assessment was bleak\nand it was reasonable (though erroneous). This example may be poor. This is of little\nconsequence, since alternative examples are easily available.\nThe hypothesis that we may make a difference should serve as a hyper-stable\nworking hypothesis. It is my alternative to the ideas of Popper and of Bartley about\nthe choice of a theory of rationality. Let me explain.\n2. Between Classical Rationalism and Fideism\nThe starting point here, to repeat, is the admission of the skeptical criticism of the\nclassical theory of rationality: proof is impossible. Advocates of irrationalis m often\nuse this criticism as the rationale for their rejection of all theories of rationality and\nof all proposal and demand to behave rationally. Those who reject the classical\ntheory but wish to adopt another add some adjective to the name of the theory of\nrationality to differentiate it from a theory that they might endorse. The adjectives\noften used are &#34;traditional&#34;, &#34;classical&#34; and &#34;Cartesian&#34;; Karl Popper suggested\n&#34;comprehensive&#34;, since the classical version advocates the comprehensive demand to\naffirm no view ever except proven ones.\nBeing comprehensive, classical rationalism demands to jettison all of familiar\nideas, so that the learning venture should begin afresh with no assumptions, with a\nclean slate, and with utterly open minds. In brief, classical rationalism is radical.\nDescartes attempted to apply it in his celebrated thought experiment, performed in\nthe hope that starting afresh guarantees the establishment of a true, scientific image\nof the world. He failed, as did all of his disciples.\nThe classical theory of rationality bumps into two interlocking standard\nobjections. The first is the classical skeptical argument: proof is question-begging.\nAn obvious logical way to overcome this is by the admission of some sufficiently\nstrong initial basic axiom. The standard examples are, the principle of the simplicity\nof nature, or of limited variety, or of induction. Some other axioms are available as\nwell. Their adherents defend their choices with a new argument that exposes the\ncomprehensiveness of classical rationalism as further weakness: the principle,\nwhatever it is, requires the assumption that it suffices for the development of a\nrational worldview and of science as we know it. This added assumption repeatedly\nmeets with a refutation that exposes the proposed principle as not good enough.\nConsider then the opposite extreme: irrationalism. Its advocates recommend\ngiving up rationality; this fascinates those who find the irrational attractive, appealing,\noverpowering: they are tired of rationality. They are intentionally unreasonable,\nforgetting that the intellect is the most powerful instrument that Nature has put at the\ndisposal of humanity, and the refusal to use it is lamentable. The advantage of\nunreason, however, is that it is license for the use of poor arguments. Those who use\nthis license denounce logic as perverse, as opposed to human natural healthy instincts,\nor to tradition or to traditional religion, or to whatever else they may advance as\nsuperior to reason. Yet, as a mere working hypothesis, this reveals some interesting\nideas. Prominent among these is the view of the first irrationalist, Heraclitus, the\nfamous pre-Socratic thinker, who probably reacted to the first version of rationalism,\nthat of Parmenides. Plato's Socrates called irrationalists mysologists, the haters of\nlogic (Phaido). Despite this hatred Heraclitus offered some valuable criticism of\nrationalism and some new ideas. Nevertheless, here let us dismiss misology.\nIrrationalists need not giving up the use of the intellect. Its use does not require\nany recognition of it as an authority over all thought processes \u2013 it can be useful\nwithout being authoritative in any way. Hence, irrationalists may have a choice in\nspecifying what portion of their thought process the intellect is not to control, as long\nas the choice does not intervene with their ability to use logic, even with a vengeance,\nin areas deemed well within the province of reason, such as mathematics and physics\nand their practical applications. What then is the suggestion to limit rationality?\nWhere exactly does rationality cease to adjudicate? The irrationalist literature has\nmany answers to this question that serve well as merely working hypotheses.\nThe better of the disenchanted with classical rationalism distinguish between\nthe criticism of the classical theory of rationality that all of them endorse and the idea\non which they disagree as to what to place outside the domain of the intellect. They\nrightly insist that the latter is less important than the former, since it leads them to\nagree that some presupposition, no matter what, must obtain with no rational basis,\nno matter upon what other kind of basis it might rest; indeed, they may add, one may\nendorse quite arbitrarily any presupposition as the initial basic axiom for rationality.\nSome presuppositions are so useless that they are overlooked. (For example, the\nassertion that Superman exists will be obviously utterly useless here.) They\nadvocated arbitrary presuppositions are usually far from being satisfactory too, but as\nworking hypotheses they may be handy and when one fails its advocate may abandon\nit for another. Of course, being irrationalists they may also cling to it dogmatically.\nAn example of this dogmatism is collectivism, made popular by \xc9mile\nDurkheim, one of the two acknowledged fathers of modern sociology. Most\nirrationalists endorse collectivism dogmatically, despite its obvious defects; they take\nas their initial basic axiom tradition, religious or national, or some authority,\nintellectual or political, or any other item that they declare vital for the maintenance\nof social stability. Their basic axiom then is that society with no stability is too\nobjectionable to take seriously into consideration as a viable option. This is sad, but\nthere are sad options on the opposite side too, namely on the side of individualism.\nAs a stable working hypothesis this is very common in the social sciences. It is\nespecially popular as Max Weber, the other of the two acknowledged fathers of\nmodern sociology. He took as the initial basic axiom for rationality a personal faith.\nThis is the source of the label \u201cfideism\u201d (&#34;fideo&#34; means, I believe). Advocates of\nfideism stress the logical impossibility of rationalism as long as it is comprehensive,\nand the need to choose an initial basic axiom in order to reinstate it. Assuming\nnothing, one has no reason to activate the project of developing rationalism and a\nrational worldview. This is the so-called &#34;the tu-quoque argument&#34; (meaning, you\ntoo): comprehensive rationalism is impossible, therefore, rationalism too rests on an\ninitial basic axiom, namely, that rationality is at all possible and desirable.\nRather than ask, what did Weber use for proof, let us examine the tu-quoque\nargument. Supposing that it is valid; does this support fideism? Does it exonerate the\nutter arbitrariness (absence of logic) of the choice of an initial basic axiom? It does\nnot sound right. Most advocates of fideism believe in their tradition and Weber hated\ntradition and expressed faith in science. This observation is so obvious that we must\nascribe its neglect to its being taken for granted: of course, the initial basic axiom has\nto be sufficiently rich in content to enable it to save rationalism from its initial\npredicament. That we take this constraint for granted is obvious, yet the systematic\nneglect of its articulation is a remiss, since there is an obvious need to specify its\nfeatures and discuss them. Now, how should we decide whether our chosen initial\nbasic axiom is strong enough? Should it perhaps also be not too strong? And then,\neven if we find that our chosen axiom is strong enough but not too strong, then we\nmay ask, is it unique? If it is, then we can eschew fideism even in the light of the tu-\nquoque argument \u2013 as unnecessary: the constraint to classical rationalism imposed on\nit by the tu-quoque argument then leaves no room for any arbitrariness and it then\nbecomes eminently rational as the most efficient means to rescue rationality.\nThis move is very welcome, as it dispenses with the most undesirable corollary\nto fideism, namely, the claim that there are different and equally legitimate kinds of\nrationalism, depending on one's pre-logical choice of one's initial basic axiom, and\nthat the validity of each is constrained by its alternatives. What is said here may be\ntrue or false, but it is a way out of the predicament of classical rationalism that is not\nfideist in the usual sense of the word, as it employs the tu-quoque argument without\nconceding the arbitrary choice of any axiom.\nThe undesirable corollary just mentioned was praised by the great fideist and\nmystic anthropologist Sir Edward Evans-Pritchard as most desirable. This makes his\nfideism not so arbitrary. Any defense of the choice of an initial basic axiom will then\nbe rational. And then it is better to take as the initial basic axiom Russell's celebrated\nproposal.  Another proposal, perhaps even better, was introduced by Popper in\nChapter 24 of his classic The Open Society and Its Enemies of 1945: the belief that\ncriticism bespeaks progress. He called this &#34;the faith in reason&#34; and characterized it\nas the minimal required deviation from comprehensive rationalism. Russell hoped\nthat his a priori supposition would permit reinstatement of classical rationalism in\nsome attenuation; Popper offered a fully-fledged new theory of rationality as\ndisproof. If any suggestion for an initial basic axiom is acceptable, then a theory of\nrationality is possible such that it is neither classical nor fideist, and this regardless of\nwhether the proof or disproof is taken to be the criterion of rationality. The claim is\nthat the arbitrariness of the initial choice does not follow from the tu-quoque\nargument, so that it can be made quite rationally.\nIf classical rationalism is to be fully restored, however, it is not enough to\nqualify it rationally: proof has to be shown possible. If it is, then an example will\nestablish this possibility. Is there any? It is easy to adduce proofs, and even of diverse\nkinds, mathematical, scientific, and legal: for convictions in murder trials evidence\nshould establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and at times it is declared achieved.\nSkeptics and advocates of fideism admit that such proofs exist. The question is the\nsame as, would such proofs be acceptable to Descartes as valid? We do not quite\nknow what kind of proof would satisfy Descartes, and probably he himself did not\nknow that either. To restrict the discussion to mathematics will not do; he would not\nagree to this. Also, this would not help as controversy still surrounds the question,\nwhat are proofs in mathematics? Descartes did offer a criterion for valid proof, but it\nis unclear and by now abandoned. To be clear about what valid proof comprises, a\ntheory of proof is required. But then, naturally, whatever this theory will turn out to\nbe, it will be question-begging. It is this very observation that led to the ancient\nskeptic conclusion that proof is impossible. Hence [classical] rationality, too, is\nimpossible. So, the followers of Pyrrho, the Pyrrhonists, suggested that one should\nnever adopt any view, that one should always suspend judgment. Fideism is not any\nphilosophy that takes some initial axiom for granted: most philosophies do so.\nFideism is the endorsement of the skeptical critique of classical rationalism as\nlogically unassailable, plus the refusal to abide by the proposal to suspend all\njudgments or the observation that no one can follow this proposal. Advocates of\nfideism declare the only way out of skepticism the initial endorsement of some basic\naxiom prior to the acceptance of the rationalist canons of proof. Taking this last\nsentence seriously one may see that whether the proposals of Russell and of Popper\nare satisfactory or not, they have unquestionably rendered a great service by refuting\nthis fideist assertion: feasible or not, they show the existence of alternatives that are\nnot as arbitrary. They have thus sensitized us to the inconsistency of the advocates of\nfideism who defend their initial basic axioms, and even without stating them\nexplicitly.\n2. Between Fideism and Critical Rationalism\nThe question, which axiom to endorse, seems to advocates of fideism beside the\npoint: as the choice of an initial basic axiom is arbitrary in the sense that (for logical\nreasons) it is pre-rational and so not rational. Here some doubt as to the sincerity of\ncontrary notwithstanding.\nadvocates of fideism may be raised: how come they usually endorse the faith of their\nfathers, whatever this happens to be? They retort that this choice is the most\nconvenient. This sounds as if convenience is the supreme criterion of choice.\nMoreover, which choice is more convenient invites the investigations that they\nforego. One may try for comfort different initial basic axioms one after the other:\ntake as an initial axiom the thesis that repetition renders choice progressively\nintelligent and reasonable. This kind of conduct, and the decision to adopt it, is\nrational. The best variant of fideism, then, the one closest to the fideist own mode of\nreasoning, is to make a basic decision afresh each day. Advocates of fideism may\nreject this as it is inconvenient, but then, criteria for convenience as well as feels for\nit are no initial axioms and so they can be overruled. To conclude, even if fideism is\ntrue and an arbitrary choice of some initial axiom is required, it need not be final.\nSome existentialist philosophers say that a commitment to an initial axiom that is not\nlife-long is not serious. But to take seriousness as more compelling than intellectual\nprogress makes it one's initial basic axiom, and an inadmissible one at that, since it\nruns contrary to logic by blocking all criticism. Admitting this, however, demands\nthat every candidate for initial basic axiom should prove irrefutable.\nAdvocates of fideism ignore the range of choice of initial axioms to employ as\nthe basis of rational thought, possibly because most of them are traditionalists and\nonce they succeed to reconcile their traditional faith with rationalism they are content.\nIf so, then this is their initial basic axiom: they are traditionalists and rationalists. Is\ntheir choice arbitrary? Some of them endorse their traditions without examination;\nothers defend them in the name of social stability, and of these, Evans -Pritchard and\nothers, conclude that different traditions hold for different societies. They defend\nrationalism while rejecting the classical Cartesian hostility to tradition.\nAll this is conjecture, which is thus suspect, especially since finding any\nrationale to the fideist initial basic axiom deprives it of its arbitrariness and so of its\nvery fideism. But then, whenever advocates of fideism argue for their fusion of\ntradition and reason, they do so by defending their initial basic axiom \u2500 as arbitrary\nor otherwise \u2500 they are advocates of fideism no longer.\nMost non-religious advocates of fideism are pragmatists; they advocate faith in\nscience for practical reasons. This invites a careful distinction between pragmatists\nproper and pragmatist advocates of fideism: the former view usefulness as the basic\ncriterion for belief in any opinion; they deem utility the ground of belief: according\nto them rationality is not proof but usefulness. Hence, like Popper, they offer a non-\nclassical, theory of rationality and so they are not advocates of fideism at all. Hence,\nthe best criticism of pragmatism proper is the observation that in order to decide what\nidea is useful we need some workable criterion of rational decision between the\noptions that the choice of this or that hypothesis is most useful. Advocates of fideism\ndo not claim that utility or any other criterion is a criterion of rationality; rather, they\ntake it as the initial basic axiom that is chosen prior to being rational, as the\nprecondition for it; other than that, they adhere to the classical view of rationality as\nproof, and so the strong criticism of pragmatism just voiced does not apply to their\nview. One may, of course, suggest that the initial choice of rationality is not useful,\nbut this is an initial basic axiom, a dogma not subject to critical debate.\nToday taking science to be the most useful set of beliefs to advocate is\nextremely popular. Its popularity suggests that possibly behind it stands mental\nlaziness plus the hypothesis that following the majority is most convenient. This is no\nfideism. Nor is the thoughtless adherence to the majority view, nor is the view of one\nwho has never examined one\u2019s views and who does not know what exactly it is. It\nmay but need not be fideist proper. It is clear that these differ; the question is, does\nthis difference make a practical difference? A difference, to be a [real] difference,\nsaid arch-pragmatist William James, must make a [practical] difference. Is there a\npractical difference between pragmatism proper and pragmatist fideism?\nAt least this should be observed: the tu-quoque argument makes it clear that\nthose who use it view us all as advocates of fideism at heart, whether we know it or\nnot; and then even if everyone behave in the fideist manner, the advocates of fideism\nare still practically better off as they possess a greater self-awareness. But surely,\nwhether this is so or not is both forever question-begging and empirically decidable,\nwhich is absurd.\nPragmatists have replaced proof with utility as the criterion of rationality.\nOther criteria may be proof-substitutes too. Each of them may serve as an alternative\nto the classical theory of rationality or as a fideist basis for the quasi-classical one.\nThis depicts the whole scheme in a new way. For, now the question is generalized:\npragmatists or others who take utility or any other quality as their supreme criterion,\ndo they use it repeatedly and eschew proof proper, or do they use it initially and then\nrequire proof? Is theirs an alternative rationalist view or is it a quasi-rationalist one?\nThis is a big difference, as it is procedural and so it effects almost every deliberation:\ndeliberations may employ proof (though on the basis of an arbitrarily chosen axiom)\nand they may employ an altogether different criterion of rationality.\nThis reasoning may expose pragmatism as a version of fideism; it also exposes\nadvocates of fideism as rationalists for all intents and purpose, as long their initial\nbasic choice of rationalism is not challenged. Their discussions can, perhaps also\nshould, be scrutinized as to whether or not, in addition to their axioms, advocates of\nfideism usually advocate the demand for proof. Now, clearly, almost all discussions\nincorporate some initial hypotheses, except for Descartes' radical thought experiment\nand its alternatives, all of which are now judged unavoidably failures. Hence, there is\nno practical difference between the fideist mode of arguing and other, except for one:\nwhenever what they happen to consider their initial basic axioms happens to be\nchallenged, they refuse to discuss it. Here, all of a sudden, the tu-quoque argument\nbreaks down and drops out of the picture. Contrary to it, there is a basic difference\nbetween the fideist and others: we all exempt some dogma from the demand to\nexamine it rationally, but the advocates of fideism exempt their own dogma\nconsciously and systematically and for good. This is a great self-awareness, and one\nthat they might naturally take pride of. It turns out to be their awareness of their\nirrevocable commitment to a dogma, and as a necessity. But this turns out to be a\nmistake: there are better ways to handle the situation.\nThe very use of the tu-quoque argument rests on error: it is used as an excuse\nto exempt from rational scrutiny some unspecified view, on the basis of the\nobservation that usually we all do so (since the skeptic critique of classical\nrationalism is valid). But we all do so now and then, whereas advocates of fideism do\nso come-what-may. This is why the suggestion to keep one's initial axiom floating is\nso deadly to fideism; its hidden assumption is that their retreat to commitment is a\nleap of faith in the sense of Kierkegaard, as Bartley has discovered.\nBartley saw the situation this way: taking the tu-quoque argument as support\nfor fideism is placing it on the borderline between rationalism and irrationalism and\ninvites efforts to refute it: its refutation is required not for irrationalists but for\nrationalists. He was in error: the tu-quoque argument is but a variant on the skeptic\ncritique. Even were it unanswerable, it would remain better to take reason upon faith\nthan to be defensive about some proper dogma. This point belongs to Popper. It is\nlovely. In his effort to dodge Bartley\u2019s criticism he lost it. pity.\nThis is no defense of classical rationalism, of course, since the skeptic critique\nof it as question-begging is taken here as valid, even if only as a working hypothesis;\nthis is to dismiss the fideist critique as no boost for it. This dismissal holds equally\nfor classical rationalism and to any other variant. To make this evident, let us\nconsider the idea of the ancient Pyrrhonist school, the view that one can live w ithout\nadherence to any view, with total and permanent suspension of judgment, and that\nthe practice of the suspension of judgment provides peace of mind (ataraxia). This is\nquestionable, but let this ride and let us ask, is Pyrrhonism fideist? Possibly, as a\nmatter of fact, every school has an initial basic axiom. Even were this true, as neither\nschool has noted this, it is hard to decide which of the two schools is nearer to\nfideism, the Pyrrhonists or the classical rationalists. That there is a great practical\ndifference between them, however, is all too clear. Hence, the tu-quoque argument\nmakes no practical difference even between skeptics and classical rationalists, though\nthe skeptical argument clearly does.\nI know Popper and Bartle agreed that they d isagreed; I do not know on what.\nPerhaps Popper has offered a new comprehensive theory of rationality that is less\nquestion-begging than comprehensive classical rationalism, perhaps not; Bartley\nclaimed that he did and that Popper did not; but then perhaps both did and perhaps\nneither did. If both did, and if both did not, are the views of the two identical? For\nuncontested background information, the very demand for openness to criticism is\ntaken for granted. Popper\u2019s innovation that Bartley endorsed but that is still the\nminority view is the assertion that this demand suffices for rationality, including the\nrationality of science. Popper's theory of rationality is very far-reaching, and is far\nfrom obvious. Bartley found it admirable but defective in not being comprehensive.\n3. Between Popper and Bartley\nscience Adolf Gr\xfcnbaum who calls himself neo-Baconian and denies Popper his originality.\nWhereas classical rationalism broke down because it is comprehensive, fideism is\npainful because it is not. Hence, rejecting both amounts to rejectingwhat they share:\nthe idea that rationality is proof. Consider, then, critical rationalism, the idea that\nrationality is disproof. Can we not show both options of it, qualified and\ncomprehensive, likewise painful? Can we apply the skeptical argument to\ncomprehensive critical rationalism and find it wanting, and then to apply the\nrationalist critique of fideism to qualified critical rationalism, and then be done with\nit altogether? Let me defeat this program.\nConsider first the application of classical rationalism to critical rationalism\n(qualified or comprehensive). This way critical rationalism fails of course. This has\nbeen showed repeatedly in the literature, yet it is trivial. Moreover, this is offered as\nfatal criticism, yet it is no criticism at all: there is no reason why critical rationalism\nshould submit to the rules of classical rationalism. Should it be applied to itself\ninstead? That classical rationalism should be proven by its own light is clear. But\ncritical rationalism should be held open to criticism, perhaps, or else it should be\nqualified. Here possibly Popper and Bartley disagreed. What is the reasoning here?\nCan we discuss this matter without begging the question?\nThe claim that logic is obligatory is inherent in the history of the debate over\nrationality. Hence, it is not contested that the aim of criticism is to refute its object.\nFrom the very start Popper stressed that he never adjudicated the matter of the\nsuccess of each piece of criticism, that all he said in general was no more than what\nlogic requires: if and when a piece of criticism is judged successful, then it is thereby\nalso judged as having refuted its object. To repeat, Popper offers as a solution to the\nproblem of rationality not a logical truth, but a conjecture, the novel theory that\ndisproof suffices for the advancement of knowledge in general and of science in\nparticular. How does he know that disproof suffices? He does not; it is his conjecture.\nQuery: is it rational to advocate this presupposition, this initial basic axiom? Can\nthere be a critical debate of it? If not, it seems fideist; if yes, it seems comprehensive.\nWhich is it?\nAssume that we must choose some initial basic axiom; how can the choice be\nrational? Given Popper's theory of rationality as openness to criticism, the answer to\nthis question is obvious: to the extent that it is criticizable and open to criticism, it is.\nDoes this apply to Popper's own choice? Should a critical rationalist be open-minded\nabout being open-minded? This is hard to say. Let us try to do so by splitting critical\nrationalism into two theses, one minor, one major, so that the question splits into two\nas well. The minor thesis is that criticism is binding. Is it? In other words, is logic\nbinding? The major thesis is that disproof suffices for intellectual progress. Is it? Till\nnow adherence to logic was taken for granted; nevertheless, possibly, comprehensive\ncritical rationalism requires an examination of our commitment to logic.\nAlready Plato asked, how binding is logic? In the end of his Phaedo,\ndescribing Socrates' last minutes, he ascribes to him the refusal to give up reason;\nnothing, Socrates seems to say, will sway him away from logic: he will never be a\nmysologist: even in his last hour he will gladly accept criticism. It is hard to say\nwhether this reading of the text is right, since the question is intricate. But Popper's\ntext seemed to me clear enough \u2500 until he declared Bartley's reading of it erroneous:\nI then began to doubt my reading of his text. For a lark, however, let me cling to my\nold reading of his text, as examining a view is more important than its authorship.\n(Besides, the first author of qualified critical rationalism is anyway Plato or Heinrich\nHeine.) To avoid all misconception of my motive, let me repeat: this discussion is no\ndefense of Popper or of Bartley, since I dissent from both.\nPlato's insistence on open-mindedness, his refusal to be open-minded about it,\nseems to identify rationality with logic. This is not clear, especially since formal\nlogic was invented later, and since it was not satisfactory till the twentieth century, if\never. So logic was open to criticism. Is it still? If yes, can its authority be revoked? In\nother words, can there be a critical debate on the rationality of logic, and if it is found\ndefective, can it be taken for granted? This depends on what we mean by the demand\nto reject a refuted version of it. If it is the demand to improve logic, then yes; if it is\nthe demand to jettison it, then no. Hence, in the broad sense logic is not given to\nrational deliberations, and so it is the initial axiom of rationality. Yet, in the narrow\nsense logic is very much given to rational deliberations, and this is expressed in the\nperennial efforts to improve it. (This seems to be the major thrust of the critique of\nthe view of logic as above criticism that we usually ascribe to Van Quine.)\nThis holds for all possible versions of the theory of rationality, since, to repeat,\ndiscussion of it was always conducted within logic. And then, Popper's claim that\nrationality is not comprehensive can be seen (not as a concession to fideism but) as\nmaking explicit a point that was traditionally taken for granted and that the modern\nhistory of logic makes its explicit statement desirable: the broad commitment to logic\ninvites efforts at its improvement in detail. Once this is noted, the discussion of\ncomprehensiveness has to be recast in a more precise manner. For example, the\nadvocates of fideism' commitment to their tradition is less irrational if it is only a\nbroad commitment, while being open-minded about any detail of it. (This is no small\ndifference, as it replaces the refusal to engage in intellectual traffic between different\ntraditions with a proposal to have it, at least up to a point, but the point is movable.)\nPopper has advocated this attitude to tradition in his classic if neglected 1947\n&#34;Towards a Rational Theory of Tradition&#34; [Popper, 1963].\nWith more due care, then, Bartley's comprehensiveness may read, his\ncommitment to logic is rational since he is open to its critical assessment. The same\nholds for Popper, of course. Where, then, is the difference between qualified and\ncomprehensive critical rationalism? Perhaps the difference lies in the disagreement\nabout the major thesis, the thesis that the engagement in critical debates suffices for\nthe advancement of learning. Since criticism involves logic, the discussion of the\nmajor thesis involves the minor one, but we need not go over this ground again.\nSuppose that the thesis that criticism suffices for progress is refuted, then. What will\nthis suggest to critical rationalists? Again, it seems, it will invite an improvement, not\na total overthrow. This seems to be the attitude advocated and practiced by both\nattitudes. So how do they differ?\nThis is not an idle thought. Critical rationalism was criticized both ways: once\n\u2500 by Feyerabend and myself \u2500 with the observation that at times the suspension of\ncriticism (at least for a lark) is wise (as Popper admitted citing Galileo to that effect)\nand once \u2500 by myself \u2500 with the observation that scholasticism was critical but not\nprogressive. The reason for this defect is clear: scholastic criticism was conducted\nwithin a given framework that was not given to criticism; this was done consciously,\non the ground of the view that debates have to be limited by some initial basic axio m,\nvery much in the fideist manner. Popper was aware of this: in his early work he\ndemanded that the most theory most given to criticism should be examined first, and\nhe later criticized the scholastic theory, which he called &#34;the myth of the framework&#34;.\nHe was thus unclear if not inconsistent. The way to overcome the inconsistency is to\nspeak of maximal criticism instead of criticism when wording the thesis of critical\nrationalism. Popper suggested that the demand for maximal openness to criticism\nwill eliminate, or at least sufficiently prevent, the use of ad hoc hypotheses, as there\nreduce the level of openness to criticism of hypotheses.\nExcept that this was criticized too \u2500 also by myself. Many theories in\ntechnology are very open to criticism yet are very much ad hoc; efforts to put them to\ntest are made repeatedly, as they are of great technological value. Yet they are not\ndeemed intellectually as interesting as the scarcely testable theories that are on the\nforefront of theoretical research. Since critical rationalism does not differentiate\nbetween pure and applied research, it demands improvement. This holds for Popper\nand for Bartley equally.\nSince qualified critical rationalism demands openness to criticism not only in\nthe abstract but also as exhibited in the possibility of a concrete criticism, in the high\nrisk of the theory in question, Bartley could ask Popper, how great should this risk be\nbefore it is deemed great enough? Popper had an answer to this question already in\n1935, but only as far as science is concerned: the risk is measured there by the\nlikelihood of an experiment that can be designed and performed to refute the theory\nin question; this likelihood can be measured by some extant alternative or by\ncommon sense. But Popper himself admitted in 1945 that weaker kinds of criticism\nare possible, in history and in philosophy, including ethics. How much should the\nrisk be a real one? (Significantly, Bartley took seriously the weak criticism that\npseudo-intellectual sects directed against the established commonwealth of learning.\nHe suggested [Bartley, 1990, 100] that since the academy is so very dogmatic, these\nfleeting intellectual clusters are where the action really is. This view is intriguing but\nalas not serious.) Nor is that all. Popper spent much of his effort arguing that\ncriticism is beneficial, which should be incontestable, and that the theory of\nrationality as the critical attitude does not suffer from the skeptical critique. Bartley\non his part spent much time arguing that since critical rationalism is not hit by the\nskeptic critique it can be held comprehensively. But they both argued prematurely,\noverlooking the critical examination of the claim that they perform the task for which\nthey were designed.\nThe question that the classical theory of rationality came to answer is, what\ntheory should be believed? Critical rationalists refuse to answer this question, as it\nprefers the diversity of opinions. Rather, it comes to exclude the theories that are not\nreasonable to believe, beginning with traditional local myths. The wish to promote\nthe progress of science is better than the wish to believe in current science. Proof\ndoes not do it; does disproof? No; critical rationalism never guaranteed success. Can\nit at least explain success? No; explanation amounts to guarantee: to say that A is\ncaused by B is to guarantee the presence of A in the presence of B. Critical\nrationalism guarantees not the success in providing conjectures and their criticism,\nbut that when these are present, progress obtains. How? The answer is what makes\ncritical rationalism so very intriguing: criticism is not the cause of intellectual\nprogress; it is intellectual progress. This, however, is a new conception of progress,\nand it can be challenged. We have not shed light this way on an important matter:\nwhy is the Popper-Bartley dispute important? In answer to this Bartley said,\nerroneously, because the tu-quoque argument is a serious challenge. This challenge\nmay signify at most for critical rationalism, not for science proper.\n4. Rationality as Partial and as Social\nWe see again that the discussion requires better presentation. Let us begin with\nrationality, whatever it is. Rationality as proof is an all-or-nothing affair; criticism is\npossibly more graded. Consider it a matter of degree. I. C. Jarvie and I have\nintroduced this idea decades ago. The measure of the degree of rationality, we\nsuggest, is not some abstract scale but depends on the available intellectual tools. It is\nclear, we said, that for one living in a preliterate society the most rational act and\nattitude will be much inferior to that available to one living in a society familiar with\nscience. This enters the social dimens ion into the debate, and so it really needs going\nover and, when necessary, recast. This is no small matter. Traditionally the options\navailable to social philosophy were individualism and collectivism. As collectivism\nnaturally distrusts individual reason as disruptive, it tends to be irrationalist.\nIndividualism then ruled the debate on rationality. And as individuals depend on\nsociety to this or that extent, though not wholly, their rationality should be cast in\nsocial terms and then viewed as partial.\nTo take a simple example, whereas traditional advocates of fideism discussed\nthe matter of rationality in an individualist framework, they could hardly answer the\nquestion, how should I choose my initial axioms? They did not have clear instances\nof initial axioms, and it looked as if infinitely many alternatives are available. Asking\nthe question in a social manner it becomes the question of the choice of a community,\nand there are a few communities to join; moreover, one cannot change communities\nevery week, and so, for merely technical reasons, one must live on one so as to\nacquire is basic tenets. It was stressed by Michael Polanyi, that when one joins a\ncommunity one scarcely knows what it has to offer, especially if the community in\nquestion is the scientific community, and that when one learns the initial basic\naxioms one may find that they are not given to simple articulation. He stressed,\nhowever, that one can belong to more than one community without fear of\ncontradiction. He did not elaborate. Another historical example should serve as\nevidence of the defect of the abstract discussion that Popper still participated in: the\nold scholastic tradition is not considered as rational as the new scientific tradition\n(even on the supposition that the old gave birth to the young). I skip the details here.\nAs long as science plays the role of a paradigm of rational activity, the\nindividual is most rational when joining the scientific community. Popper has\nsuggested that science is a social institution, one that encourages criticism. He also\nsuggested that parliamentary democracy is such a paradigm, and the same holds for\nthat paradigm. That there may be inconsistency between science and democracy, as\nwell as within each, is no reason for defection, as it may be a challenge for efforts to\nimprove. Popper said, the reason for these being paradigms of rationality is that\nrationality is the effort to improve through criticism.\nCan we rephrase the Popper-Bartley dispute within a social framework? All\ntheories of rationality recommend joining actively the life of science and of\ndemocracy. The view of rationality as improvable goes better with critical\nrationalism than with classical rationalism. Is here a significant difference between\nPopper and Bartley? Can we rephrase Bartley's philosophy socially? I do not know.\nThe critical attitude commends both a personal openness to criticism and an\ninstitutional setup that encourages criticism and is open to reform. The criticism of an\ninstitution, or of an institutionalized opinion, however, is not the same as the\ncriticism of an individual's opinion: the one is a personal matter, the other is social.\nValid criticism should always lead one to the search of alternatives, and reform is\naccepted not after criticism is voiced and endorsed but after a viable alternative is\nfound and tested in instituted manners. What this means for Popper is clear enough:\nboth democracy and science are open to reform. What does this mean for Bartley\nabove and beyond what it means to Popper I cannot see. Perhaps this means that\npossibly democracy and/or science will be criticized in a new manner that will lead\nto a proposal of a totally new regime and/or research protocol and Bartley will be\nwilling to test it. Whether this is so or not is hard to say: the discussion becomes too\nabstract here.\nBibliography\nAgassi, Joseph, 1981.

 'content': u"Michael S. Myslobodsky, ed.,\nThe Mythomanias: The Nature of Deception and Self -deception.\nHillsdale NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, 1996, pp. 23-50.\nDeception: A View from the Rationalist Perspective\nBy Joseph Agassi,\nTel Aviv University and York University, Toro nto\nSelf- Deception in General\n&#34;A Liberal Decalogue&#34; suggests (Russell, 1967, pp. 60-61) not\nto envy people who live in a fool's paradise: It is a place only\nfor fools. This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's\nparadise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of\nopinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down,\nthat reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when\nall is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of\ntheir situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to\nget them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is\nlittle that can be done about it, except that the wise would still\nprefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic\nmore constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the\nreassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable\nalternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - -\nso that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to\nmobilize some appropriate action.\nAlternatively, fools may tell themselves that there is no risk.\nThis is self- deception, and the question is, why do people\ndeceive themselves and take risks? To take a concrete\nexample, people with weak hearts may avoid taking precautions\nand prefer to live like normal people and risk instant death\nfrom heart failure. This is possibly a rational choice. Yet some\nwho suffer from weak hearts pretend, even to themselves, that\nthey are normal. It is hard then to say whether they have\nchosen to live normally and take the risk. Perhaps they prefer\nto take precautions, and yet do not do so because they are\nunable to look the risk straight in the face.\nMore sophisticated ways of living in a fool's paradise are\nknown. One may live there knowingly. One may feel that one\ndoes not share the reassuring received opinion, yet pretend\nthat one does. This is what Russell warned against: Anyone\nwho knowingly chooses to live in a fool's paradise is still a fool.\nAnyone who thinks that awareness of one's living in a fool's\nparadise immunizes one to its dangers is a fool. This is self-\ndeception about one's ability to cope with deceit. Many\nphilosophers have noted that people who habitually deceive\nfinally fall for their own deceptions. This is the well-known\nphenomenon that confidence artists appeal to the willingness of\ntheir victims to deceive both themselves and others in one and\nthe same act: The victims are encouraged to deceive\nthemselves into thinking that they deceive only others while\nignoring their own greed and the immorality of the way they\nchoose to satisfy it. To this Russell added that the same holds\ntrue for all self -deception: Those who think they can live in\nsituation of self-deception without deceiving themselves finally\nfall for their own self-deception. The seemingly wise deceive\nthemselves that they only pretend that they endorse the\nreassuring hypothesis: They do not know the cost of the\npretense, which is the neglect of thinking out the viable\nalternatives.\nThe reason one endorses the reassuring hypothesis despite\nattempts to immunize oneself is complex. It is in part\nintellectual: One does not invest in the examination of\nalternative hypotheses. It is in part social: One cannot discuss\nalternative possibilities when one pretends to the world that\none is committed to the reassuring hypothesis. It is in part\npsychological: One is ambivalent about matters, and one\nreassures oneself that one does not need the reassurance.\nThe case of self- deception, in brief, is complex. It involves\nerror, impatience in thinking out detailed matters,\nunwillingness to examine each and every obvious option, and\nalso deception proper. Yet clearly something is missing here: It\nis fear and obsession. As Freud was first to notice, self-\ndeception usually rests on the stubborn reluctance to consider\nalternatives when these are suggested by others.\nNot all cases of self -deception, however, are cases of life in\nfool's paradise. This phenomenon is usually associated with the\nself-deception that involves whole social groups. The social\ncase is more complex than the personal case. The personal\ncase of self -deception is puzzling because its victims refuse to\nconsider corrections suggested by their environment. The case\nof the fool's paradise that is group self -deception, usually\nnational, is different and more complex: A whole society\ndeclares a certain option not open to public discussion. Its\ngiven rationale is that it is dangerous to discuss different\noptions -- because it will help other people or discourage our\npeople. Indeed, it is very similar to the case of the confidence\nartist: The group (national) leadership suggests that, although\nour case may be shaky, we may be able to succeed if it will be\nnevertheless accepted, and for this it should be presented with\nfull confidence. All that is missing from the picture to complete\nit are two true observations. First, many political leaders are\nconfidence tricksters, and they see themselves as such.\nSecond, confidence tricksters make a profession of deceiving\nthemselves that they deceive only others. In principle, the n,\nthe difference between the two cases -- the private and the\npublic -- is only technical: Both are cases of reluctance -- of\nnot allowing oneself to examine views that deserve to be\nexamined, where an excuse for this reluctance is left\nunexamined as well . The two cases differ as to the excuse\noffered for the reluctance. To make the difference purely\ntechnical, what is needed is to observe, as is explained in detail\nhere, that any effort to present a case authoritatively -- be it\npersonal, social, politica l, or intellectual -- is in itself nothing\nshort of self-deception.\nIn summary, when one deceives oneself, one does not know the\ncost of the self -deception, and it is usually this that makes the\nerror significant. In other words, however irrational any c ase of\nself-deception looks, when one unpacks it, one finds it not very\nproblematic. The inability to see this rests on a difficulty that\nenters the picture with the introduction of a theory of\nrationality. Two important theories of rationality are found in\nWestern philosophy. The earlier of the tow is the more\nimportant. It was known as the rationlist theory, and now it is\nknown as classical rationalism. It identifies rational action with\none based on rational belief and rational belief as that which\nrests on proof of sorts (Agassi, 1986a; Agassi &amp; Jarvie, 1987,\nChapter 16.) The other important theory is romanticism: It\nidentifies rational action with one based on strong intuition:\nOne acts rationally when one is true to one's inner self, when\none listens to the right inner voice. This theory, be it true or\nfalse, is not given to rational discussion for the following\nreason. There is only one argument against it: By listening to\none's inner voice, one can make tragic decisions. The followers\nof the romantic theory of rationality are not dissuaded by this\nargument for reasons that are good or bad. Whatever is the\ntruth of the matter, the followers of the romantic theory are\nunshakable. Hence, there is no point in pursuing this discussion\nunless and until someone comes up with a new suggestion (for\ndetails see Agassi, 1982).\nThe rest of this chapter is devoted to a discussion of the\nclassical theory of rationality and of its implications for the\ncase of self -deception. At the end, a new avenue for the theory\no f rationality is highlighted. The newer theory of rationality is\nmore commonsensical, as it takes rationality to be a matter of\ntrial and error. Thus, it permits the discussion to proceed along\nthe lines suggested here.\nRationality and the Social Order\nThe prevalence of self -deception is part of folk knowledge; it is\nthe target of a rich folk literature, and of more sophisticated\nliterature as well. It has not puzzled people, however, until the\nadvent of modern times. The reason is not far to seek: The\nphenomenon began to puzzle people when it conflicted with\nreceived opinion and/or when it constituted a challenge that\nwas surprisingly hard to meet. The surprising difficulty\npresented by a challenge testifies to the presence of a theory\nin the light of which it should be easily met. The theory that\nhuman beings are rational is the source of the trouble:\nObviously, self -deception is not rational.\nAs long as the received opinion was that human beings are\nfoolish, or unreasonable, it was expected that they sho uld\nbehave erratically, deceive themselves, and so on. Clearly, this\ntraditionally received opinion was an unavoidable corollary to\nthe traditionally received religious doctrines of the Western\nworld prior to modern times: The wages of sin are slight and\nmomentary and the cost of sin is eternal damnation; Hence\nnothing is more rational than to behave properly. Yet people\nwill sin (&#34;the flesh is weak&#34;). The prevalence of sin was taken\nby all the traditionally received religious doctrines of the\nWestern world prior to modern times as conclusive evidence of\nhuman irrationality.\nThe situation was taken quite differently by most of the modern\nrationalistic philosophers, the classical rationalists: They\nconsidered the prevalence of sin to be evidence that sinners\nsimply do not believe in eternal damnation. They reasoned\nthus: Rational people act in accord with their beliefs; people do\nnot act in accord with the belief that their actions will lead to\neternal damnation; hence, clearly, they do not believe in\neternal damnation. Moreover, the classical rationalists taught\nthat it is important to hold the right beliefs. To this end, beliefs\nshould be adopted rationally, and then all will be as well as can\nbe expected. Self-deception, however, does not fit the classical\nrationalist prescription: Classical rationalists always viewed it\nas the willful deviation from rational belief. Its prevalence,\nthen, is, or seems to be, a refutation of their theory of rational\nbelief. Hence its centrality for their theory of rationality -- for\nthe theory of rationality presented in the classical rationalist\ntradition (Agassi, 1977, 1991).\nThis last point deserves a slight elaboration. Practically all\nWestern religious traditions and practically all folk wisdom\nconstantly preach the restraint of natural human appetites on\nthe ground of the (false) observation that selfish conduct\nobviously undermines social stability. The classical (Western)\ntradition of rationalist philosophy disagreed with this teaching\nand rejected this observation (as obviously the very opposite of\nthe truth). It declared any desirable restraint better achieved\nby reasonable, self- reliant individuals than by those frightened\nby hell fire and brimstone. Classical rationalists preferred, on\nthe whole, not to prescribe restraint. They did not deny that\nsome restraint is reasonable. Yet they considered particularly\nerroneous the demand to avoid greed and selfishness. The\nreasonable, self- reliant individual, they taught, will practice the\nnecessary self- restraint anyway. The end of rational conduct is\nalways selfish, as action comes to satisfy the natural appetites\nof actors. Hence, the best way to act, the best way to achieve\none's end, is to behave intelligently - - to act as a reasonable\nself- reliant individual (Agassi, 1 986b).\nIn brief, the classical (Western) tradition of rationalist\nphilosophy rejected as too strict the preaching of (Western)\nreligious traditions and folk wisdom for the restraint of natural\nhuman appetites. Its preached reasonable self- reliance, on the\nopposite view that reasonable, self- reliant individuals are\nbetter able to judge how strict their conduct should be.\nRational action is best guided by thought; Hence, the problem\nof rationality is less a question of the choice of a mode of\nconduct and more the question of the choice of the right belief\nto endorse. The problem then can be limited, at least initially,\nto rational belief.\nThe 17th- and 18th-century rationalist philosophers were\nliberals. They learned to argue against the traditional religio u s\nrequirement for strictness, which was based on the observation\nthat the unintended social consequences of selfish action are\nsocially undesirable. The liberal philosophers suggested, on the\ncontrary, that some social conditions ensure that the\nunintend ed social consequences of selfish action are socially\ndesirable. Under such conditions, then, following natural\nappetites, selfish actions will (unintentionally) support social\nstability rather than undermine it. If so, instead of preaching to\ncurb natural human appetites by the threat of hell fire and\nbrimstone and eternal damnation, it is wiser to create\nconditions that will make selfish conduct socially beneficial:\nThe readiness to act selfishly is more reliable than the\nreadiness to curb selfish motives merely out of fear (Gellner,\n1992, 1995, p. 8.)\nInitially, in the 17th and 18th centuries, the theory of\nrationality was prescriptive rather than descriptive. It became\ndescriptive in the 19th and 20th centuries, with the advent of\nmodern social science . It was recognized then that it is well\nworth investigating the facts of the matter, to observe what\nactions some extant ideas bespeak, and how. This created a\nneed to distinguish explicitly between the two kinds of\nrationality: (a) the intellectual ratio nal choice, the choice of\nbeliefs or of opinions to endorse; (b) the practical rational\nchoice, the choice of the right conduct. This distinction is\nbriefly denoted as the choice between rational thought and\nrational action, or that between thought and action. The need\nto make this distinction explicit was first presented in modern\nsociology. It usually goes by the name of Max Weber, one of\nthe acknowledged fathers of that field, who made his studies at\nthe end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th cent uries.\nNow the classical rationalist assumption is that action is guided\nby thought, and rationally this is done as best as possible.\nHence, the problem of rationality can be limited, at least\ninitially, to the problem of rational thought: What opinions\nshould one endorse? What is rational to believe in? What\ncriterion of choice of a belief should one endorse? The best\nsolutions to these questions, the classical rationalists taught,\nwill ensure the best solutions to all problems.\nRationality and Self- reliance\nQuestion: why did the classical rationalists find it so important\nto insist that, by the classical rationalist recipe, all is as well as\ncan be expected?\nAnswer: Because throughout the history of classical\nrationalism, its adherents have opposed the re ligious doctrine\nthat humans are evil and replaced it with the classical\nrationalist gospel of self- reliance as the road to salvation\n(Agassi, 1977).\nQuestion: If all is as well as can be expected, why is the world\nstill so frustrating, why are people so d isappointing as they\nare?\nAnswer: Because, says the classical rationalist, people are still\nnot self- reliant.\nQuestion: Why are people not self -reliant? What will make them\nso?\nAnswer: People are not self- reliant, says the classical\nrationalist, because they are captives of the [religious]\ndoctrines which they are taught, which makes them rely on\ntheir teachers. Only giving up these doctrines will enable\npeople to become self-reliant. After the act of giving up\nreceived opinions, beliefs will be as rational as can be expected\n(for more details see Agassi, 1991). The world may still not be\nperfect even when people will be as rational as possible, but it\nwill be as perfect as possible. This is the classical theory of\nrationality: Rational conduct will bring about the best of all\npossible worlds, says the classical rationalist, particularly\nbecause it will advance scientific research, and thus increase\nself-knowledge and self -reliance.\nIt was in this way that self -deception was integrated into the\nbroader system of the modern or classical rationalist\nmovement, or of the Enlightenment movement, or the moderns.\nSelf- deception, they taught, is irrational, and irrationality is\ndue to the absence of self- reliance, and this absence is due to\nlies with which one is ra ised. Members of this movement were\nhardly ever explicit about religion. Few of those who were\nreligiously skeptic dared hint at that fact. It only became\npermissible to refuse to assume the existence of God in the\nearly 19th century, after the demise of t hat movement, and\neven then there was no attack on established religion until the\nmid -19th century. Nevertheless, this much is clear: The\nundercurrent of the gospel of Enlightenment was that of self-\nreliance; the educational system was blamed for teaching ideas\nthat impede it. The education system was, of course, run and\ncarefully monitored largely by the religious establishment. In\nthe civilized world, this monopoly was broken by the French\nand American Revolutions, yet the monitoring of it by the\nreligious establishment still goes on there to this day. However,\nfew will blame the religious establishment for the widespread of\nirrationality.\nThe situation merits careful analysis. The basic classical\nrationalist tenet is this: Self -reliance is the reliance on reason;\ntherefore it is the same as rationality. It follows from this that\nself- reliance, or rationality, is the best guide to life. There is\nno substitute for thinking: Regardless of whether one is\nreligious, it was suggested, one should not rely on any church\nor leader. Some modern rationalist philosophers preached and\nstill preach religious self- reliance, of course (&#34;God helps those\nwho help themselves&#34;). Yet it was this idea that undermined\nthe authority of established churches and leaderships,\nregardless of whether and to what extent this authority was\nhostile to self -reliance.\nThe question then is, what is rationality? It was treated in a\nstandard way within the classical rationalist tradition, and its\ncurrent formulation is as follows. The question is first split into\ntwo: What is rational action? What is rational belief? The\nclassical rationalist tradition took it for granted that people\nalways act in accord with their beliefs; Otherwise they are\ncoerced by others, by the laws of the land, or by the laws of\nnature, and so they do not act freely, and so they do not really\nact. This is the distinction between action and behavior that\nentered the literature. (Behaviorism, accordingly, is the view\nthat people never act in this sense of the word -- tha t they are\nalways coerced to move as they do by the combination of the\ngeneral laws of nature and specific circumstances. The standard\nclassical rationalist view rejects this doctrine and takes for\ngranted as a fact the repeated observation that people do act.)\nAssuming, then, that people act, it follows that they act\nrationally. It then follows that if their beliefs are rationally\nheld, then their conduct is as good as can be reasonably\nexpected. This seems reasonable, and even commonsense. It is\ncommonsense, of course, only on the supposition that humans\nare naturally rational and self- reliant, that irrational conduct is\ndue to childhood indoctrination in unreasonable beliefs, and\nthat this indoctrination can be overcome for the asking. This\nmeans that peo ple are rational unless they are deceived. Why,\nthen, do people insist on being deceived? Why are people\ngullible? Classical rationalism offers no answer. This is the big\ngap in the classical rationalism of the Enlightenment\nmovement. This doctrine is still very popular, and so the gap is\nstill conspicuous.\nThus, the prevalence of self- deception is the major refutation\nto the doctrine of natural human rationality which is at the root\nof the doctrine of the Enlightenment movement. Moreover, all\ndeception is due to the fact that some of it is successful, and\nsuccessful deception is possible only because many people\nallow themselves to be deceived. Why do they? Because they\ndeceive themselves about other people's credibility. Admittedly,\nsince rational opinio n is at times erroneous, one may be\ndeceived without self-deception. Yet, since reason is the best\nguide, if the rationalist philosophy is true, it will prevent\nconstant systematic error. Systematic error is the result of\ninsistence on it, of the mistrust of reason, and so it is due to\nself-deception. Even the trust in the teaching and\nindoctrination during childhood is a form of self -deception. It is\npossible and rationally obligatory to give it up and be set free.\nYet people often cling to their education. They deceive\nthemselves to trust it. The question that classical rationalism\nhas to answer is, why then do people allow others to deceive\nthem systematically? According to classical rationalism, what\nprevents bridging the gulf between the best, which is the life of\nreason, and the real, which is the practice of systematic error,\nis self- deception alone. This phenomenon deserves special\nattention: It is any systematic error that cannot be viewed as\nanything other than self- deception: All effort to correct it are\nmet with unintelligent excuses.\nError and Sin\nThe ethics of the Enlightenment movement, of the modern\nphilosophy of life, is simple: &#34;Reason is and ought only to be,\nthe slave of the passions&#34;, as David Hume has aptly put it\n(Hume, 1980, Bk. 2, Pt. 3, Sec. 3). On this view, self- interest\nis the only right motive force for action, provided it employs\nreason to the full, which, of course, is eminently reasonable.\nHence, all sin is violation of self -interest, and so, at bottom, all\nsin is error. This is the doctrine of enlightened self-interest. It\nis scarcely new. In antiquity it was known as the Socratic\ndoctrine of eudaimony ('eu' is good and 'daimon' is spirit; the\nname refers to the story, narrated in Plato's The Apology of\nSocrates -- Socrates explains that he is the wisest by reporting\nthat he has a good Fairy Godmother who prevents him from\ndoing what he does not want to do, which is not good for him).\nThis doctrine is particularly hard to defend, since experience is\nmore in accord with the opposite doctrine, according to which\nhumans are both wicked and self-destructive. Thus, the moral\ndoctrine of classical rationalism appears to be empirically\nrefuted.\nThe rejoinder to this criticism comes in two steps. The first\nmove is to reduce all self -des truction to self -deception -- on\nthe supposition that as self -destruction hurts oneself, it is\nnever desirable and so it is never reasonably desired. (It is\nunnatural.) The second move is to reduce wickedness to self -\ndestruction. The way to effect this last reduction is to show\nthat the wicked are sawing the branch on which they sit. This is\nshown by the claim that, as their need for friends requires they\nshould be benevolent not wicked. This is unsatisfactory, as it\nmay work for friends, perhaps even for p otential friends too,\nbut not ever for enemies. It looks eminently reasonable to be\nvicious to them. Then different arguments are marshaled. An\nappeal is made to providence: It is in one's best interest to be\non good terms with divine powers. This, too, is unsatisfactory,\nas it is an appeal to the wishes of the divine, not to those of a\nself- reliant actor. The holders of the monopoly on divine\npowers always oppose self- reliance. An appeal may then be\nmade to one's need for peace of mind, and hence for peace\nwith one's conscience (he conclusion of Hume, 1980, explains\nmartyrdom this way). This, too, is unsatisfactory: Conscience is\nbased on religion, and the exercise of eudaimony was initially\nintended to do away with it, and for good reasons: Clearly, it is\nnot conscience, but the sense of guilt, that disturbs the peace\nof mind. This sense of guilt is forcibly established by religious\neducation to undermine self- reliance. All advocates of self-\nreliance recommend that the sense of guilt be eradicated\n(Kaufmann , 1973; Agassi &amp; Agassi, 1985).\nIt is still possible to defend the doctrine of eudaimony, or\nenlightened self- interest: Self -destructive action is prevented\nby the sufficiently clear understanding of its consequences. The\nstandard contemporary example is smoking, but any bad habit\nwill do. The victims of a bad habit know that their conduct is\nnot in their self- interest, but only in a vague manner: They\noften refuse to see it clearly until their physician convinces\nthem that they are killing themselves. Then many of these\npeople find themselves freed of their bad habit with no effort at\nall. Hence, the intensified energy and sense of guilt invested in\nefforts to stop a bad habit are forms of self -deception: What is\nneeded is not effort nor strong will, but clear understanding of\nthe harm it causes, say the sages of the Enlightenment.\nAs it happens, all this is neither here nor there. Whatever the\nrule is for right behavior, it is clear that self-deception is not\nthe right mode of conduct, yet it is prevale nt. Even the\nassumption that all wickedness is due to self-deception does\nnot help vindicate humanity very much, since self- deception is\nevidently wicked: The pure at heart will hardly fall for it.\n(Others are guilty of the sin of pride.) Hence, regardless of\nwhether one should be as fully self- reliant as possible, and\nwhether the canons of right conduct are those of enlightened\nself- interest, self-deception is both erroneous and sinful, yet it\nis regularly practiced. Why? In particular, is it the sin of it that\nbrings about the error, or is it the other way around?\nBefore we proceed, we may wish to know, what does it matter?\nImperfection is a familiar fact, as are both wickedness and\nstupidity. Why does the old party insist that all impropriety is\nsin, an d why does the new party insist that all sin is error? Why\nnot lump them together, or say that impropriety and\nmisconduct are at times due to error and at other times due to\nsin (and often due to both)? After all, criminal law says exactly\nthis: Criminal c ourts are often called to adjudicate and decide\nabout the reason for some misdeed - - is it due to sin or to\nerror? Moreover, such courts also distinguish between\npermissible and impermissible error. (This is the root difference\nbetween murder, premeditated or not, and involuntary\nmanslaughter or accidental killing.) Why insist on reducing\nerror to sin or the other way around?\nThe answer is this: Suppose that behind every sin lurks some\nerror. The way to reduce sin is then not by preaching, but by\nenlighte ning. This is the explanation that historically stood\nbehind the Enlightenment movement's optimistic view of\nhumanity: Sinfulness is allegedly a part of human nature,\nwhereas ignorance certainly is not. But this is questionable:\nJust as one may say that be hind every sin is error, one may\nalso say that behind every error is sin. Ignorance leads to\nexcusable error only, whereas the error of people's ways are\ndeviations from the straight and narrow. Established religion\ncomes to prevent sin, and it teaches the true doctrine, but\npeople who are wicked will not listen. Thus, according to all\nestablishments that issue rules of proper conduct, self-reliance\nis the cardinal sin. (Hence, science can have no such\nestablishment! This is conspicuously false, yet in the Age of\nReason, in the time when classical rationalism flourished, it\nwas much more reasonable than it is today to assume that\nscience has no establishment whatsoever.) Here, again, we\nmeet the source of the disagreement: It is this question --\nwhat is bett er to rely on, individual self- reliance or traditional\nwisdom?\nThis does not solve the problem at all. The fact remains that\nboth morality and science are cultivated. Why try to eliminate\none of these? The answer is that one depends on the other:\nWisdom, says established religion, begins with the purity of\nheart (&#34;the beginning of wisdom is the fear of God&#34;); ethics,\nretort the enlightened, begins with the intelligent employment\nof reason. Does this dispute matter? Should it not be ignored\nand both morality and reason be employed?\nAll this will still not do. This discussion is stuck with the\nproblematic phenomenon of self -deception; it is admittedly\nboth stupid and wicked; It is better eradicated, but no one\nknows how. Even the combined use of both expla ining and\npreaching does not overcome it, and so there is a genuine need\nto learn more about it so as to cure it. The two common\ntheories identify it as a sin as well as an error, yet they differ\nas to which one is the source of the other. Which is it then? In\nthe hope of finding a better cure, a better understanding of\nself-deception may be sought. In this search, attempts may be\nmade to criticize both theories.\nBacon's Doctrine of Prejudice\nThe present discussion has got into a loop as sin and error are\nreducible to one another: Even if all error/sin is sin/error, it\nseems that the very disposition to err/sin lies in our\nmoral/intellectual imperfection. All humans are disposed to\nboth sin and error, and it is hard to decide which of the two\ndispositions lies deeper. Moreover, as this discussion concerns\nself-deception, it is important to note possibly self -deception is\ninexplicable even were it known if error is the cause of sin or\nvice versa. The curious historical fact is that the presentation\nof the problem was first forcefully made by Sir Francis Bacon,\naround the year 1600. He solved it not by any attempt to\nchoose between blaming sin for error and blaming error for sin\nbut by blaming self-deception for both. He was not concerned\nwith the question, which comes first, sin or error? He was not\nconcerned with social and political philosophy. He had a\ntremendous vision: A great scientific revolution is in the offing,\nand it will bring about a great technological revolution. He was\nconvinced that most social and political problems would be\nsolved by the technological revolution. Until then, he\nrecommended, a conservative attitude to politics should\nprevail.\nAs Bacon was convinced that technology would be\nrevolutionized by the development of scientific knowle dge\nproper, his sole concern in most of his writings was to help the\nadvancement of learning (for a detailed discussion of all this,\nsee Agassi, 1988b). Bacon took for granted the ancient doctrine\nof how enlightenment comes about: The pure mind is prepared\nto perceive the truth in an intuitive experience of sorts. This\ndoctrine is generally known all over the world as mysticism\n(see Agassi, 1981b, Chapter 23). There is much confusion here:\nThe mystics proper do not claim that their knowledge is given\nto cle ar articulation, yet the Platonic and Aristotelian theories\nof learning do. Hence, these theories are not quite mystical;\nthe neo -Platonic or cabalistic doctrines are mystical. The\ncentral question that this raises is, how is the mind purified? It\nengaged Bacon as it engaged many others before and after\nhim. (Different mystics have offered different rituals for this\npurpose.) Everybody agrees, of course, that, to that end, the\nmind has to be of a righteous man -- free of error. The\nquestion remains, how is the mind of cleansed of its errors?\nBoth Plato and Aristotle recommended critical debate as the\nmeans to that end. (Aristotle called this method 'epagoge', and\nthis word was translated into 'induction'.) It is the method of\nquestioning that ends up with de finitions, said Aristotle, as\ninvented by the Pythagoreans and perfected by Socrates and\nPlato. Definitions are the foundations of science, Aristotle\nadded, and they constitute the source of all true knowledge.\nBacon agreed about all of this except for the ancient view of\nthe efficacy of critical debate.\nCritical debates, said Bacon, have gone on in universities for\ncenturies, yet to no avail: Each party sticks to its guns. The\nreason is simple: One can always ignore criticism, or dismiss it\nwith a wittic ism (&#34;this is an exception that proves the rule&#34;),\nor, if one is obliged to take account of it, one can make a new\nsubtle distinction, to make a small exception, or otherwise\nbelittle the worth of an argument.\nThis raises two central questions. First, is it always possible to\nbelittle criticism? Second, why should one do that? The answer\nto the first question is in the affirmative. It is a powerful part\nof logic, known today as the Duhem-Quine thesis. Exceptions\ncan always be classified in a different category. (To take a\ncommon example, the prejudiced who recommend the\ndiscrimination of any sort of people may admit that an instance\nof the sort in question is unjust; they will then place these\ncounterinstances in a separate class and cling to their prejudic e\nagainst the remaining members of the discriminated sort. For\nmore details about the Duhem-Quine thesis see Agassi, 1994.)\nThere are different attitudes to criticism. Duhem said science\nmust accept criticism only in small doses so as to maintain its\nco ntinuity. Why should science do that? Duhem did not explain,\nbut the truth is that he was defending the same medieval\nmethod that Bacon was attacking because he greatly respected\nthe same medieval thinkers Bacon despised. Bacon declared\nthem enemies of pro gress; Duhem declared their contributions\nessential to the history of science. Bacon denied the very\nexistence of mediaeval science; Duhem was its first great\nhistorian. More important, Bacon agreed with the ancient\nrevered philosophers that total scientif ic knowledge of the\nwhole universe is possible; Duhem did not. Bacon declared the\nneed for one and only one scientific revolution -- the one that\neradicates all prejudice and all error; Duhem advocated\ncontinuity and denied the possibility of scientific re volutions.\nBacon envisaged a tremendous explosion of science; Duhem\ntaught that science proceeds in small steps. Bacon ignored\nmathematics altogether and recommended for the mind free of\nprejudice to collect as many and diverse observations of simple\nfacts as possible, and to proceed slowly and carefully towards\nthe goal of total scientific knowledge; Duhem saw this as naive\nand insisted on the need to develop the mathematical\napparatus that is essential for scientific knowledge and fitting\nthe facts within it.\nHow is one to judge between these views? Probably most\npeople will reject both, at least because at least two scientific\nrevolutions have occurred, contrary to both. Bacon was too\nradical in his demand to clean the slate with no theory left and\nDuhe m was too conservative in his claim that science suffers no\nrevolution as each stage of it depends on a previous stage\n(Agassi, 1957, 1963, 1981b. See also the biography of Duhem,\nJaki, 1984).\nBacon was a Utopian visionary in the style of his time -- the\nearly 17th century. He based his vision on a new idea: He\nassumed that the rejection of all preconceived opinions and the\naccumulation of a vast collection of items of factual information\nwill lead rapidly to the full growth of theoretical science.\nFurthe r, he was deeply convinced that this growth will bring\nsalvation, and that salvation is around the corner because\neveryone is naturally disposed to contribute to the growth of\nknowledge (Bacon, 1994, Bk. I, Aphorisms 15 -18). Why, then,\nis salvation not here already? Because there is a small obstacle\nto it: The sins of laziness and pride. People offer conjectures\ninstead of working hard in the search for the truth, and then\nthey refuse to admit criticism as it puts them to shame. Thus,\nthe demand for the purity of mind includes the demand for\ndevotion and humility, caution and resistance to the temptation\nto conjecture. Once one has made a conjecture, one sees the\nworld as conforming to it, is then bound to endorse it as true,\nand is then trapped in it: It be comes a fixed feature of one's\nintellectual makeup. (This is corroborated by contemporary\ncognitive theory: One who endorses the theory that all is x, say\ncognitive psychologists, sees x everywhere; x can be atoms,\nlife, sex, selfishness, or anything else.)\nPrejudging matters instead of letting facts speak for\nthemselves, Bacon explained, is the acceptance of a bribe. His\nexplanation is subtle, and reminds one of what the Bible says\nof it (Exodus, 23:8): Bribery blinds the wise. That is, one says\nto onese lf that one is wise enough not to be blinded by the\nbribe, but to no avail. The very bribe, argued Bacon, is what\nblinds one to the truth, as it is the flattery to oneself. It is only\nself-deception that stands between humanity and salvation\nthrough science. People flatter themselves that they are\ncleverer and more knowledgeable than they are, thus getting\nblind to criticism. Moreover, the psychology of perception as\nfirst offered by Bacon, and as still taught today, suggests that\nnothing can be done about it. To become a good researcher,\nsaid Bacon, one must humbly admit ignorance, and relinquish\nall the preconceived notions that one happens to have; only\nthen, he said, will one qualify to seek knowledge, and even\nthen this holds as long as one does not pro nounce opinions.\nBacon's idea is generally rejected nowadays. It is generally\nagreed that people cannot live with empty heads. (Only some\ndevotees of popular cheap versions of Oriental mysticism\nendorse the false view that some techniques empty the head of\nall ideas.)\nThe observation that theory blinds one to facts that offer\ncriticism of it is a central part of contemporary psychology of\nperception and cognition. It often goes today by the name of\nthe 20th -century psychologist Leon Festinger. This observ ation\nhas led some thinkers, such as Giordano Bruno and Galileo\nGalilei of the 16th and 17th century, to the obvious conclusion\nthat such observations spuriously validate the theories that\ninvoke them. Bacon agreed but claimed that a theory can be\nproperly validated -- when it is rooted in unbiased\nobservations: As long as theory precedes observation, he said,\nits validation by facts is assured for all those who propound it\nand for no other; only if it emerges by itself out of many and\ndiverse observations, he assured his reader, is the result truly\nassured and will convince all. Hence, proper observation begins\nwith the cleaning of the observer's mind, and therefore\nobservers must be humble and attend to small facts, not aspire\nto be the proud originators o f great philosophical systems.\nWhy is the sin of pride so special in the scheme of things? Why\nare all sins to be viewed as errors, yet pride the sin at the root\nof error? Bacon answered that pride too is but error; of course\nit is a form of self -deception. It is the error that is the source\nof all errors, as it inhibits the natural disposition to learn the\ntruth; it perverts the natural order of things by placing theory\nprior to observation, like building a house beginning from the\nroof.\nBacon stressed that the matter is subtle. There was no known\nreason to forbid the making of conjectures before he discovered\nthat conjecture perverts the mind so that it is essential to\nrelinquish all preconceived notions before one can contribute to\nthe advancement of learning. Because the natural disposition to\ndevelop science is stronger than the disposition to make\nconjectures, Antiquity had knowledge and no reason to advance\nany conjecture. Then conjectures were advanced, especially\nthose of Aristotle, and they were wicked. Once knowledge was\nperverted, it could not be restored without Bacon's new cure --\nhis prescription of cleaning the slate and proceeding with\ncaution. Naturally until then self -deception was the rule.\nAccordingly, Bacon called his philosophy &#34;The Great\nInstauration&#34;, meaning the return to the golden age of\nAntiquity.\nA Short History of Self- Deception\nSelf- deception, to repeat, is ubiquitous, as is the folk literature\nabout it. Also, folk literature presents self -deception as self-\nflattery. This is a point that Bacon's doctrine makes central.\nBacon's proposal of a remedy had an old component and a new\none. The old component is the following advice: Do not be\ngullible, trust no one but the facts and your own reason. The\nnew component is; Discard all earlier opinions and start afresh.\nThis is Baconian radicalism, and this is what characterizes\nmodern, classical rationalist philosophy. Its most specific\ncharacteristic is its being Crusonian, as Popper and Gellner\nhave called it (Popper, 1945, vol. 2, pp. 219-20, 215; Gellner,\n1995, p. 7; see also Agassi, 1981b, pp. 477-85, 488). As\nDescartes found out, after cleaning one's slate and before\ndeveloping one's own philosophy, one is utterly alone. In the\n19th century Descartes' philosophy and his venture, the\nBaconian venture of starting afresh, were not as popular as in\nearlier centuries. One of its opponents was Kierkegaard (1985,\nPreface), who nevertheless admired Descartes for having the\ncourage needed for this venture. As this venture was deemed\ncentral to modern, classical rationalism, understandably,\nrejecting it led many, Kierkegaard included, to reject\nrationalism itself.\nThe reason that self -deception is the single obstacle, and such\na formidable one at that, is simple. Almost any obstacles that\nmay lie on the way of a self- reliant individual may be handled\nin the best manner available. The only insurmountable obstacle\nto self -reliance is self -deception, since its victims are unaware\nof its very presence. Classical rationalists deemed the Baconian\nventure of cleaning the slate indispensable because it is easy to\ndeceive oneself: As long as one holds to any opinion, to any\nopinion whatsoever, one is too well disposed toward it. Hence,\nthose who rejected Bacon's radicalism were disposed to the\nview that self -deception is unavoidable. After Bacon had\ngranted prominence and significance to the disposition for self -\ndeception as the chief obstacle to the advancement of learning,\nand so to advancement in general, it became clear that the\ndisposition to be rational depends on the single condition that\nself-deception be avoided. The irrationalists then centered, as\nthey still do, on this question: Can this single condition ever be\nmet? Irrationalism is the correct denial of the possibility of\navoiding all self- deception and the erroneous conclusion that it\nis better to rely on tradition, the leadership or one's gut -\nfeelings than on oneself.\n(Bacon's radicalism is not new: It is cabalistic in origin. Why\ndid the performance of the cabalistic ritual fail to bring\nsalvation? Because there is a catch here: To be valid, the ritual\nshould be perform by a deserving individual, and that individual\nmust be humble. But it is hard to be humble when one brings\nsalvation to the world. Why do people end up in hell if they\nmay repent even at the gates of hell? Because the wicked are\nhaughty, and, at the gate of hell, they deceive themselves that\nthey are there not deservedly, but out of good will - - out of the\nwill to save its inmates.)\nThe advocacy of self-reliance look as if it were identical to the\nadvocacy of rationality, and either looks as if it were identical\nto the advocacy of the avoidance of self- deception. The\nopposite of self-reliance is the reliance on others, who are not\nreliable, since there is nothing to rely o n except one's own\nreason. Hence, the reliance on others is being deceived and all\ndeception is self -deception at heart. According to Bacon, the\ntransition from reliance on others to self -reliance takes effort,\ncourage, and much good will. This is particularly so because,\nwe remember, according to Bacon, self -reliance begins with the\ncleaning of one's slate -- with starting afresh. This, as\nKierkegaard stressed, is rather frightening. It also leaves too\nmany questions unanswered, such as, what should one do in\nmatters pertaining to one's means of livelihood and of one's\nreligion? These questions were hardly ever dealt with.\nDescartes reported that he would not embark on the project of\ncleaning his slate before he had answered them to his own\nsatisfaction. To day, almost all students of this matter agree\nthat these questions were hardly ever dealt with, and they can\nnever be satisfactorily answered.\nThis is a significant point. Children have faith in a Santa Claus\nof one sort or another, and in their having m others. Somehow\nthe faith in Santa Claus fades away, but having mothers is\nnever questioned. (Feminists have a point, then, when they say\nthere could never have been a female Descartes.) The demand\nthat one should doubt even the existence of one's body, then,\nis only understandable in the sense that the extant scientific\ntheories of bodies should be doubted. Indeed, the idealists who\ndenied the existence of matter did not question the\ncommonsense view of matter and of their own having emerged\nout of their mothers' wombs. They questioned the theory of\nmatter propounded by Descartes, by Newton, or by other\nphysicists. It is no accident that the Baconian program and its\nexecution by Descartes concerned the improvement of the\nnatural sciences and technologies, hardly the improvement of\nthe social sciences (or the moral sciences, to use the\nantiquated terminology), and even less so the social and\npolitical technologies. The application of the Baconian program\nto social and political studies came later, as an afterthought,\nand its application to political affairs was unexpected and\nbizarre.\nThe Baconian project -- his plan to develop science - - was a\ngreat success, as was his idea that technology will develop\nmagnificently on scientific foundations. His view was e choed by\nhis followers John Locke, David Hume, and, above all, Adam\nSmith (Hal\xe9vy, 1955, p. 433). During the French Revolution it\nwas echoed by Condorcet (1976; see also Schapiro, 1934). It\nwas the faith that scientific -technological progress will\ninevitably improve social matters without much ado. This\nBaconian aspiration -- to save humanity through the\nadvancement of science and technology -- failed totally,\nalthough not before it landed humanity in the modern world --\nindustrial, post-industrial, and developing -- for better or\nworse.\nThe first great fiasco of the Baconian program to save humanity\nthrough the advancement of science and technology was the\nFrench Revolution. The idea is not new that the revolution was\nthe daughter of the ideas of the Enlightenment movement,\nespecially its radicalism. This idea was advanced by the leading\nReactionary thinkers, Edmund Burke and Georg Wilhelm\nFriedrich Hegel (see Agassi, 1977, pp. 218 -20). They did not\nsay it out right, but their followers did: People want to b e\ndeceived. They want that because they cannot practice self -\nreliance. This Reactionary idea helped the tyrants of the\nmodern, developed world immensely, and caused untold harm.\nThe Reaction had much less of a vision and no program, yet\nbeing conservative it could always fall back on tradition. The\ncentral idea of the Reaction, then, was that people need\ntradition to tell them what to believe in. This takes the central\nidea of the Reaction out of the present discourse. The Reaction\nmade a concession to the Enlightenment movement: Some\nindividuals can be self -reliant. They prove it by going into the\ndesert and staying there without food, drink, or company for\nforty days and forty nights. The Reaction deprived even the few\nself- reliant individuals of their reason: They are exceptional\nbecause they are extremely ambitious, and they follow their\nown bent no matter what. This is a recommendation for self-\ndeception on a grand scale. It suggests that the exceptional\nmust be lonely and stubborn, which is what cha racterizes many\npsychopathological cases. Indeed, Hegel said there is no way to\ndistinguish between the exceptional who is a genius from the\none who is crazy, or alienated, to use the term of Pinel: To be\njudged alienated (by accepted norms) is the price for one's\ndecision to be self -reliant (until one manages to alter the\nnorms and then be declared a hero). The Reactionary doctrine\nof dependence and self - reliance is a gross exaggeration. Let us\nreturn to a more commonsensical version of rationalism\n(Agassi, 1981b, Chapter 15.)\nExtreme Rationalism as Self- Deception\nNo rule of logic is more potent than that which proscribes\ncontradictions: They are deadly. Not only are they\ndemonstrably false; declaring one true is the denial of all error,\nand so it is the admission of every possible statement.\nNevertheless, a mathematical text can all too easily include\none. In mathematics a misprint may introduce an error, and\nintroducing an error into a mathematical system usually\namounts to adding a contradiction to it (the equation 1 + 2 = 3\nbecomes a contradiction when any one item in it is misprinted).\nStrictly, the rule banning all contradictions renders all texts\nthat contain such misprints worthless. However, it is often easy\nto eliminate misprints by simply overlooking them, and this is\ndone heedlessly unless and until they cause trouble. Even\nresearchers whose ideas seem inconsistent are known to\nproceed working without worry about inconsistency, in the hope\nthat this matter will be taken care of later. It is hard to judge\nhow rational this attitude is; in the oversight of inconsistency,\none risks the waste of time in the study of a worthless system.\nIf the system under study happens to be consistent, or if the\ninconsistency in it is easy to remove, the result of the study\nmay be useful. However, often a researcher investing much\nefforts in some interesting question will obtain exciting results\nthat rest on an inconsistency, so that the invested labor was\nsheer waste.\nHere is an interesting corollary to the theory of self-deception.\nIt is one thing to take a calculated risk, regardless of whether\nthe end result is happy. It is quite another thing to pretend to\nhave taken a calculated risk, be optimistic about matters, and\nforge ahead carelessly. Often the investment o f effort is only of\nsome pleasant hours of research that one may easily afford to\nlose. It is an observed fact that if stakes are high and the\nresearcher is highly strung, self -deception steps in as the\nrefusal to entertain the merest possibility of an error. It is hard\nto differentiate the reasonable cases of calculated risk from the\ncases of carelessness, as there is no theory that tells us when\nthe risk is great and when not. Perhaps there can be no such\ntheory regarding research.\nSo much for the requirement for consistency. It is more\ndifficult to study other requirements, as these may be\nabandoned. This is the case with demonstrability - - the super-\ncriterion traditionally most generally adhered to and rightly\nmost respected. It is invalid; adherence to it causes confusion\nand self -deception. Without the assumption that philosophers\naddicted to it are deluding themselves, it is hard to explain its\npopularity, despite its great allure. Historically, it is a central\nidea, and yet today it is recognized as most baffling. What is\ndemonstrability? What theory of it is there? As its natural place\nis in mathematics, it can be examined there first.\nThe standard examples of demonstrations -- of proofs -- are\nmathematical, especially those of Euclid and of Archimedes. By\nmodern standards, the quality of these demonstrations is very\nlow. Russell (1917, pp. 66, 94-50) said that Euclid's proofs\nscarcely qualify. The first to have offered reasonable proofs,\nsaid Russell, was George Boole, at the mid -19th century (p.\n74). In classical geometry, proofs consisted of deductions from\nthe axioms of geometry. What follows from a theorem is a\ntheorem, yet two nagging questions remained unanswered.\nFirst, what makes the axioms theorems? Answer: Axioms are\nself-evident: it is impossible to question their truth. Yet at\nleast one axiom of Euclid was always questioned (for each\nstraight line no more than one parallel line goes through a\ngiven point). In the 19th century, a system of geometry was\nconstructed in which that axiom was relinquished. Early in the\n20th century, Einstein developed a theory of gravity whose\ngeometry is non-Euclidean. (It denies that space is the same\neverywhere, as it assumes that the properties of space differ\nwhere gravity differs.) So much for the self-ev idence of axioms.\nThe other question is, how is proof possible without axioms? It\nhas to do with the theorems in the fields of arithmetic and of\nalgebra. These were not based on axioms until early in the 20th\ncentury.\nSo much for proofs. As to proof theo ry, it was developed in the\n1930s by combined efforts of a few great logicians. Their work\nwas clouded by confusions, most of which were cleared decades\nlater. Perhaps even now, proof theory is too problematic, so\nthat perhaps we are still not entitled to claim possession of a\nclear proof theory, not even in logic and mathematics.\nYet the puzzling fact is that classical rationalist philosophy\nrested on the idea that rationality equals proof. An example of\nthe magnitude of the puzzlement may be useful, especially as it\nprovides the flavor of the feeling that accompanies the\nsituation. The classical and most popular work of Wittgenstein\n(1922, Preface and famous last sentence) is accompanied by an\nair of tremendous tension: It declares that, on the one hand,\nwhat it says is so obvious that its articulation is neither\npossible nor called for, and on the other hand it is so difficult\nthat it is beyond words. Much controversy rages as to how to\nread his text, and much of it revolves around the question of\nproof and provability, and of what exactly the message about it\nis. Possibly, however, the literature in question is a mere\nexpression of a tremendous sense of frustration at the inability\nof commentators to face their own inability to prove, which is\nto say tha t the literature in question is a mere exercise in the\nfutility of self-deception.\nAs proof theory developed, it was proved that all effective\nproof procedures are limited, even in mathematics, let alone\nelsewhere, were proof elsewhere at all possible. T he proof --\nG\xf6del's celebrated proof -- was rejected by Wittgenstein. In the\nmeantime, the matter has developed much further, and proof\nprocedures and their limitations have become a field of\nintensive study within computer science. What is not provable\nin one system may be provable in another, as it can be added\nas an axiom; but their addition will create other unprovable\ntheorems. Contrary to Wittgenstein, there is no comprehensive\nsystem in which the logical status of all that can be said is\ndecided once and for all.\nThe idea that rationality equals proof is most basic. It is the\nsource of much strength, but also of much self-deception --\nwithin philosophy as well as within science. Bacon,\nWittgenstein, and many others said, when in doubt one should\nrefrain from endorsing any opinion, one should suspend\njudgment, and one should never express any opinion about\nwhat is doubtful, particularly not in public. Otherwise, self-\ndeception is inevitable. This idea, hostile to self-deception as it\nis, looks immune to it. The fear that it is itself the malady it\ncomes to cure is as frightening as the idea that physicians\ncause death. The fear that the medicine is worse than the ills it\ncomes to cure produces a feeling of helplessness, and that\nfeeling is a tremendous incentive for self -deception. Indeed,\nthis is what happened when Semmelweis brought crucial\nempirical evidence to support the claim that physicians kill\npatients by not washing their hands. For decades his view and\nhis prescription were rejected by his peers. This is a clear case\nof a dangerous, irresponsible, grand -scale self-deception,\npracticed by a scientifically oriented group.\nHowever erroneous classical rationalism is, it is still very\npopular among philosophers who like it for its advocacy of the\nuse of reason and its support of science and of self -reliance.\nYet it is itself a case of self-deception. These days, the rule of\nscience is tacitly identified as the acceptance of the expert's\nauthority. This is very disconcerting, as any acceptance of any\nauthority is, as it conflicts with the demand for self- reliance. It\nis also silly. It is well known that the acceptance of the expert's\nauthority may be fatal (see last paragraph for an example). The\nstandard answer to this trite observation is that the reliance on\nexperts is unavoidable in the modern world. Even it were\nunavoidable, this does not make it less fatal. Moreover, the\nunavoidability of the reliance on experts has nothing particular\nto do with the modern world: It has always been the case, an d\nit is much less so today, when the educated citizen knows more\nmedicine than the best physician of a century ago. As the\nhypothesis that there is no choice but to rely on experts is\nrefuted, it may be replaced with increasingly better hypotheses\nthat wil l say how far and under which conditions the reliance on\nthe experts' authority is worse than doing altogether without\nthem. The reliance on experts' authority is clearly the worst\nsuperstition of the allegedly rationalist and the allegedly\nscientifically inclined, and this includes most research scientists\naround (Feyerabend, 1970).\nSelf- Deception as Fixation\nBacon's doctrine of prejudice was limited to the prejudices of\nthe researchers. Marx extended it to the views -- the prejudices\n-- extant in the gene ral population, especially the extant\nphilosophy of life. He labeled it 'ideology'. Following Hegel he\ndenied the universalism of the Enlightenment movement, and\nreplaced it with the view that the parochial views are locally\nvalid. (Hegel called the views and attitudes agreeable to the\nstate 'the Universal'.) This theory is known as relativism or,\nmore specifically, epistemic and moral relativism (see Agassi,\n1992). Every period of history, Hegel said, has its own truths,\nas created by the heroes who are the leading lights of that\nperiod. These heroes together constitute the group of\nindividuals who count -- &#34;the World Historical Figures.&#34; Marx\naccepted Hegel's epistemic and moral relativism only for the\npast -- for class society. He declared the truth in a class\nsociety to be socially determined, but he taught that, in\nclassless society, the truly universal would prevail. Hence, in a\nclass society all truths are relative and socially determined.\nHence, all ideology is class prejudice. Being prejudices,\nideologies are hard to shake off. This can only be done by\nindividuals who can peer into the mechanisms of history, like\nMarx himself -- they can divine the future society and the\ntruths of that society.\nAccording to Marx the society of his day was ruled by\nemployers, by the capitalists. He predicted that the ruling class\nof his day were destined to be replaced by employees, by the\nworkers. He viewed other philosophers as captives of capitalist\nprejudices. He viewed himself as the mouthpiece of the future\nsociety. He viewed the prejudices of the capitalists inferior to\nthose of the workers. He therefore held the view that the views\nhe was holding were superior to those held by other\nphilosophers.\nThis is Hegelian: The top representative of humanity, be it the\ntop nation (Hegel), top class (Marx), top civilization or culture\n(Spengler, Toynbee), or anything else that is tops, is tops in\neach and every respect. Hegel had a simple justification for this\nbizarre idea: The best is the militarily strongest, and the\nstrongest takes all that is of value -- the way Napoleon robbed\nthe countries he conquered of their artwork. Hegel and Marx\nnever explained why the arts and sciences always progress and\nthey disregarded the historical facts of regress. The most\nconspicuous fact that Greek art and science are superior to\nmediaeval art and science was brushed aside with the aid of\nthe claim for the superiority of the mediaeval political system\nor its agricultural technology over its predecessors. This is only\nevidence that being superior in one dimension is no guarantee\nfor superiority in another. This option did not occur to Marx nor\nto Marxist scholars in the middle of the 20th century. (The\nfamous scientist and historian of science J. D. Bernal (1939,\nChapter 2, Section 1) declared flippantly that medieval science\nis superior to Greek science. (See also Bernal, 1952, 1954, p.\n209; Agassi, 1963, Chapter 7 and notes.)\nTraditionally, philosophy was reductionist: It recommended that\nevents that belong to the different human sc iences should be\nexplained by theories from only one human science. Traditional\nreduction was to psychology: All human science, it was\nsuggested, are at heart psychology: Sociology, politics and\neconomics are really parts of psychology. Bacon's doctrine of\nprejudice was perhaps behind this trend. When Hegel reduced\nthe individual to society and declared political history the basic\nhuman science, he declared it essential for sanity to believe in\nnational myths. Marx advocated the reduction of all human\nsciences to economics. He wanted to see all explanation of\nhuman affairs by reference to the economic conditions of the\nsociety in which they occur, chiefly in terms of the\nadvancement of its technology. Freud, however, clung to the\ntraditional recommendation to reduce all human phenomena to\npsychology. He attempted to explain the way some private\nprejudices have a strong hold on the minds of their victims: He\nwas impressed by the fact that neuroses constitute intellectual\nblind spots, especially when the neurotics who sustain them are\nintelligent. He explained this by his theory of the emotional\ntrauma ('trauma' means wound).\nFreud's theory of the emotional trauma is simple. The cause of\nevery neurosis, he suggested, is a trauma caused by some\nfrightening, painful childhood event. Initially, the trauma leads\nto an attempt to cope with it by conjecturing a hypothesis.\nBeing infantile, this hypothesis is not surprisingly of a low\nintellectual level. What is surprising is that the neurotic never\ngets over the init ial hypothesis. This, Freud explained, is due to\ntwo facts. First, reliving the traumatic incident is painful.\nSecond, one attempts to avoid that pain. For example, if one\nconjectures that the pain in question is caused by the rejection\ndue to one's lack o f achievement, one will increase one's\nefforts to achieve. The refutation of the hypothesis will only\nlead to redoubling the effort, rather than to recognizing that no\neffort will reverse the rejection (because one tries to achieve\nthe wrong object, becaus e the rejection is irreversible, because\nthere was no rejection to begin with, or because of anything\nelse). Therefore, the purpose of psychoanalytic treatment\nshould be liberating neurotics from the prejudices that are at\nthe base of their neurotic conduct, which incapacitates them.\nThis, according to Freud, can be achieved only by helping them\nrelive their initial traumatic experiences. Once this is achieved,\npatients experience strong relief and a sense of catharsis, and\nthen, according to Freud, all is well.\nThis is Freud's celebrated catharsis theory. He later claimed to\nhave refuted it to his own satisfaction. It is difficult to say what\nreplaced catharsis as the aim of psychoanalytic treatment after\nthat theory was abandoned. Possibly Freud was too hasty to\nreject the theory; Possibly the fault was not in the ascription of\ntherapeutic power to catharsis, but in the view that, after it,\nthe patient is well and the treatment is over. I (Agassi, 1981a)\nhave suggested that the recovered mental patient ne eds\ntreatment that is usually accorded to the physically\nconvalescent. When a convalescent has weak muscles, it\nmatters little why; the question is, how should they be\nstrengthened? The same may be true of the mentally\nconvalescent, whose decision power is small. If so, what\nprecisely the prejudice was that the catharsis reveals is less\nimportant than the treatment accorded to willing mentally\nconvalescents. This shows that Freud's theory is one of self -\ndeception. It is a model for a number of such theories , yet not\na sufficiently good one, as it does not take into account the\natrophy of self -reliance due to prolonged neurosis. Freud has\nrightly observed that adolescents often get rid of their\nprejudices, but not those acquired under severe traumas --\ninclud ing morality, which is thus inculcated under the\nconditions of brainwashing, said Feyerabend (1968).\nSelf- deception can be treated in all generality. It is rational to\ninquire, to seek the truth, but perhaps not at any cost. At\ntimes, the search for the truth is too costly, and its outcome is\nof little significance. In these cases, it is reasonable to give up\nthe quest. This is a troublesome catch. One remains ignorant,\nfirst, of the truth that one allows to remain hidden, and then\nalso of the cost of giv ing it up - - of relinquishing it. More than\nBacon, Freud renders self -deception as the opposite of the\nsearch for the truth. He insisted more on the relentless search\nfor the truth. Yet the limitation on the cost of the search for\nthe truth remains. Select iveness is unavoidable, and one about\nthe search for the truth is inherently blind. What should be\ndone about this? Freud was troubled by interminable analysis,\nwhich is an expression of both the excessive cost of analysis\nand its contribution to the increased atrophy of the patient's\nself- reliance.\nThis is where Freud got stuck. Bacon's doctrine relates to the\nsearch for the scientific truth. He said the search should not be\nselective, because any selection is guided by an idea, and that\nidea is a prejud ice: It is judgment prior to the presentation of\nthe relevant evidence. Even asking specific question, Bacon\nsaid, is selective. The choice of a question is rooted in a\nprejudice. To avoid prejudice, research must be indiscriminate\nand all discovery accide ntal. Freud's view of his own research\nwas orthodox Baconian; his claim that his theory evolved out of\nmyriads of observations was clearly Baconian; his suggestion\nthat analysts intervene minimally in the analytic process of\nself-discovery was based on his fear of prejudice. Yet his\ntheory was related to everyday life, where the question about\nthe search for the truth cannot be as all encompassing as in\nresearch. Thus, he could not say how neuroses-free the\naverage citizen should be (Freud, 1962, third para graph from\nthe end).\nFreud appealed to simple common sense: One often deviates\nfrom the normal healthy views of things, and one is then\nnormally corrected by circumstances or by peers. It is abnormal\nto resist this kind of correction. Abnormal resistance to\ncommon sense is at times intelligent, as in the case of a\nresearch scientist. Alternatively, it is sometimes unintelligent,\nat other times it is hardly a trouble, and still other times it\nincapacitates. This then requires treatment. Here then is the\nplace for Freud's original contribution: The neurotic resistance\nis still rational, although it is obsessive (i.e., pathological). It\nis the insistence of avoiding the pain of reliving the trauma.\nThis is a hurdle the incapacitated should be helped to clear.\nReluctance to discuss one's opinions rationally is the outcome\nof the assessment that discussion will be painful. However, one\nis never able to assess properly the cost of the reluctance to\nacquire information for want of that very information. Therefore\none should always be ready to reassess one's view that the\npain is not worth the benefit. If common sense calls for this\nreassessment and is met with an obsessive refusal, perhaps the\ncause is psychopathological. Otherwise, the resistance is better\ndiagnosed differently, especially when it expresses the fear of\nself- reliance ('decidophobia' is the apt term offered by\nKaufmann, 1973).\nConclusion: The New Theory of Rationality\nThe discussion thus far is couched within common sense or in a\nframework that diffe rs radically from the classical theory of\nrationality. Since Freud fully endorsed that theory, his\ndiscussion was possibly inconsistent -- in that it mixed common\nsense with the classical theory of rationality. Even if it is\nconsistent, it is encumbered with irrelevant difficulties, and in\nits original wording it is much harder to comprehend than its\n(more general) variant reproduced here.\nThe discussion herein also deviates from the classical theory of\nrationality in its avoidance of the theory that the rational is the\nprovable. Nor does it require an explicit wording of an\nalternative theory of rationality. The new theory of rationality\nthat is required should share with common sense the idea that\nthere is no human perfection. It should not assume any pa rt or\naspect of any product of the human mind to be perfect and\nabove error. Briefly, it should include the idea that it is\ndesirable to eliminate error as far as possible; it suggests that\nthis is done by criticism. Criticism, then, should be viewed not\nas hostile, but as help. This idea is not new, and is clearly\nexpressed in Plato's Gorgias. Yet in the writings of Plato (and\nAristotle) the rationality of criticism is presented as a mere\npreliminary to the rationality of proof. Omitting this, we receive\nthe new theory of rationality, or a variant of it: Critical\ndiscussion is not the appetizer but the main course. Hence, it is\nnot just concerning received opinions, as Plato and Aristotle\nsuggested, but an endless process of inventing ever newer\nconjectures and their refutations -- as much as is within the\npowers of the participants in the process Popper, 1945,\n[Agassi, 1995). (This raises the question, is logic perfect, and\nis mathematics? These matters are not discussed here,\nalthough they are of great philosophical interest.)\nThe assumption that criticism is rational is very rational, and\nits rejection by Bacon and his followers is a great pity,\nalthough Bacon was right to observe that critical discussion as\npracticed in the universities was an exercise in futility. The first\nmodern variant of the fallibilist theory of rationality, which\nincorporates the assumption that rationality is critical debate,\nis due to Popper (1945, Chapter 24). His theory is not free of\nobjections, especially Bacon's. Criticism may be pointless at\ntimes. It can also be an unaffordable luxury. It is impossible to\nknow if this applies to the case at hand. The theory under\nconsideration may deserve criticism and it may not: Investing\nin criticism risks wasting valuable time.\nExamp les of irrational critical thinking abound, and at times\nthey can be classified as pathological. Psychotherapists are\nfamiliar with many kinds of them. Patients are often ingenious\nat inventing new excuses that allow them to ignore or belittle\ncriticism of their views and conduct. Patients are likewise\ningenious at inventing criticisms of, and in finding lacunae in,\nthe assumptions behind threatening proposals of therapists.\nPeople often use many tools -- physical or mental -- without\nbothering about their inner mechanisms. When patients are\nafraid of using a proposal made by their therapists, they\nsuddenly show passionate interest in the mechanisms involved\nin the proposal and in critical debates about them. These\npassionate interests are delay tactics and expressions of fear.\nThe observation of Konrad Lorenz is relevant here: Conduct\nunder fear and pressure is less intelligent than the average in\nall animals. The claim made here is that even losing one's mind\nis a process due to rational conduct, but in fea r and under\ngreat stress, and so with an ever-decreasing level of rationality\n(Fried &amp; Agassi, 1976).\nThus, there are levels of rationality; the highest level available\nis hardly ever attained. It is approached only in some very\nleisurely, research -oriented discussions. Even then it is not\nalways clear what avenue is best to take (contrary to classical\nrationalism), as there are many possibilities, some of them\ninherently blind. Thus, it is only seldom clear how the level of\nrationality can be raised. Tha t the rationality of action may be\na matter of degree is common sense, and if all rationality\nshould be seen as a matter of degree, it is useful to view\nrational thought as a variant of rational action. Traditionally,\nrational thought, or rational opinion, was distinguished from\nrational action (including thinking). This is reinforced by the\ntraditional distinction between states (of mind) and (mental)\nprocesses. This distinction is subtle and redundant: Jarvie and I\n(Agassi &amp; Jarvie, 1987) have suggested to v iew thought as a\nkind of action and the theory of rational thought as a part of\nthe theory of rational action. This is meat to be a supplement\nto Popper's theory of rationality.\nThere are two points to mention before bringing this chapter to\na close. First, unlike the classical theory of rationality, the\nfallibilist theory does not split rationality sharply to the\nscientific and the rest. It also recognizes common sense and its\nprogress. (Think of the views of nutrition common a century\nago, which reco mmended what is today viewed as empty\ncalories and/or a cholesterol-rich diet; or of sexuality, which\ndeemed masturbation self-destructive and the pleasure of sex\nundesired by decent women.) It also takes for granted that, in\nscience as elsewhere, every significant criticism is an\ninvention, so that it is important to see the difficulty of being\ncritical (and so of being highly rational). This relates to the\nsecond point. The fear of criticism is rational, but not as\nrational as the effort to overcome it. Self-deception is thus a\nform of rational human conduct, but it is inferior to attempts to\novercome fear and more so to fearless openness. This is not to\nsay that every possible case of self -deception is equally\nharmful and to be equally harshly combated. O ften\npsychotherapists encounter cases that they judge -- hopefully\nrightly - - as not deserving treatment. The cases that do\ndeserve treatment, even at a great cost, Freud noted, are those\nthat grossly interfere with the ordinary course of life. Some\ncases are subtle and difficult to judge. A sense of proportion\nmust prevail in discussing them. The pursuit of the truth is\nlaudable, but it is not necessarily always the required\ntreatment.\nA sense of proportion is indispensable anyway, since there is no\ngreater self -deception than the claim that one is utterly free of\nit, as is regrettably exemplified by the great thinkers Bacon,\nMarx, and Freud. This should be remembered as a warning\nagainst excessive self -confidence: Humans are all fallible and,\nas Plato already observed in great detail, it behooves us to be\ngrateful for any attempt at criticism and correction.\nAppendix\nThe editor has drawn my attention to a very recent essay by\nAlfred R. Mele (Mele, 1996), that deserves notice because it\ncomprises a very comprehensive survey of the most recent\nliterature on self-deception, which is becoming increasingly\nfashionable these days. The literature is written from the\nviewpoint of the theory of rationality as the rational degree of\nbelief and that as the degree to which the belief is justified by\nexperience. This viewpoint was declared in this chapter as a\nversion of self-deception, perhaps also an expression of some\nanxiety. The starting -pint of that literature is the so-called\nparadox of self -deception. Assume that successful deception\noccurs when one who thinks that some statement is true\nconvinces someone else that it is not. Assume further that one\nsuccessfully deceives oneself the same way. As a result, one\ndoes and does not think that the statement in question is true.\nAs was explained here, it is easier to begin with self -deception\nand view most cases of deception as variants of it. As explained\nin this chapter, self-deception is always a form of ambiguity\nand/or confusion and ignorance, so that it is a spectrum, and\nthere is no sharp division between those engaged in it and\nthose who keep clear of it, although some people are very near\nthe one end of the spectrum and others on the other.\nMele reports numerous experiments in self -deception, with no\nregard to th e question, how well trained the subjects of the\nexperiment are in the art of self -criticism. The absence of self-\ncriticism, it was argued in this chapter, is not the same as self-\ndeception, especially since all criticism is the result of some\ncreative act . There is also the question of the cost of self -\ncriticism that the experiments discussed by Mele disregard. The\nexperimenters do not ask, how important is the self-deception\nunder discussion and how important the individuals in question\nconsiders it. Most engagement in astrology by modern educated\npeople is a mild, harmless form of self -deception that cannot\nbe taken as seriously as the case of self -deception that leads to\ndisaster.\nReferences\nAgassi, J.

  {'abstract': u"Self- Deception in General &#34;A Liberal Decalogue&#34; suggests (Russell, 1967, pp. 60-61) not to envy people who live in a fool's paradise: It is a place only for fools. This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

  {'abstract': u'Karl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason. Later on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and even called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to his annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

 u"Giuseppe Franco, editor, Der Kritische Rationalismus als Denkmethode und\nLebensweise: Festscrhift zum 90. Geburtstag von Hans Albert. Klagenfurt: Kitab,\n2012, 34-55\nCritical Rationalism, Comprehensive or Qualified:\nThe Popper-Bartley Dispute\nBy Joseph Agassi,\nTel-Aviv University and York University, Toronto\n0. Background.\nKarl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945,\nCh. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason.\nLater on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and\neven called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to\nhis annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave,\n1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter\nis very complicated. Let me show this now.\nFideism is a minimal retreat from classical rationalism. As this theory is\ncomprehensive in its demand for proof as ultimate justification, it begs the question\nof its own justification. All parties to the current dispute admit that this is a defect\nthat has no cure except by some modification. To that end adherents to fideism\nadvocate some axiom taken on faith as the minimum necessary concession to\nirrationalism. The rationalism that the advocates of fideism qualify is the classical\ntheory of rationality, that is, to be precise, an assertion plus a demand. The theory is,\nrationality equals proof. The demand is to make an assertion \u2013 or to endorse it, to\nbelieve it \u2013 if and only if proof is available that the assertion is true. As the skeptics\nhave shown, any proof of any (synthetic) assertion requires a proof theory that\nrequires proof in its turn. (The possibly of proof in logic and in mathematics has no\nplace in the present discussion.) The skeptics have then recommended holding no\nbelief, making no definite assertion, holding all views only tentatively. Skeptics\nclaim that they have a proof that no proof is possible that should satisfy classical\nrationalists. Most rationalists have invested much effort in attempts to find fault in\nthat proof, and they are still trying. As this essay concerns the dispute between\nPopper and Bartley, who both endorse the skeptic proof, we may take the skeptical\nproof for granted. Hence, the classical theory of rationality cannot stay as it is. The\nadvocates of fideism conclude, then, that some retreat is imperative. The minimal\ndeviation is an assertion that advocates of fideism recommend to endorse without\nproof. That is to say, they recommend its endorsement upon faith. There are two\nstandard candidates for that assertion: the principle of induction and the faith of one\u2019s\nforefathers.\nOf course, not all deviation from the classical theory of rationality is fideist.\nSince advocates of fideism propose that the deviation from the old view should be\nminimal, it is hard to see how this proposal is contestable. An obvious point to\ncontest concerns the question, what deviation is minimal. On this Popper has made a\nbrilliant alternative proposal. Although it has not gained popularity among advocates\nof fideism, it is obviously the best thus far offered. It is this. The least concession\nshould not be the faith in any principle of induction, much less in a given traditional\nfaith, but preferably in the possibility that rational debate may generate progress.\nAdvocates of fideism may object to this obviously superior proposal: it accompanies\na lower standard of rationality. Whereas the classical theory of rationality equates\nrationality with proof, Popper\u2019s theory equates rationality with the critical attitude.\nWhat is preferable, one irrational axiom or this reduction of the standard? The\nanswer is that the reduction of the standard is necessary anyway since the skeptical\ncriticism of traditional rationalism is valid. (Thus, Bertrand Russell advocated the\nadoption of some principle of induction upon faith in the hope that it will suffice to\njustify current science [Russell, 1992, 38]; [Russell, 1996, 313-28]. He did not\nmanage to formulate it explicitly.)\nPopper has proposed two brilliant minimizing moves: of the standard of\nrationality and of the concession to irrationalism. Bartley has shown that there is no\nneed for the two moves, as one will do. This he proved conclusively: reducing the\nstandard of rationality renders a concession unnecessary. It is a shame that Popper\nhas not admitted this, suggesting instead that Bartley just improved the wording of\nwhat he had intended to advocate all along: he denied that he made the mistake that\nBartley had attributed to him. It is likewise a shame that Bartley conflated his valid\ncriticism of Popper with his own alternative to it: only the criticism, not the\nalternative to the criticized theory, is uncontestable. The errors on both sides led to an\nimpasse. In desperation, Bartley called Popper a fideist, and Popper took offence. My\naim here is to rectify these two errors and thus restore the peace between their ghosts.\nNow the fideism that Bartley has saddled Popper with is at the very least not\nthe traditional version but an improvement on it. It says, welcome critical scrutiny as\nprogressive. If this is a version of fideism, then it is an admirable version of it. Both\nPopper and Bartley have confused this idea, be it a version of fideism or not, with a\nslightly greater demand: do not advocate a theory unless it has passed critical\nscrutiny. This version of rationalism, be it fideist or not, both Popper and Bartley\nrejected, and rightly so, despite its superiority over the more traditional versions of\nfideism. Regrettably they did not praise it before rejecting it, although by the canons\nof criticism they should have.\nTaking for granted here the skeptical criticism of traditional rationalism, let us\nconsider the question, which modification of it is right? Considering any proposed\nmodification, why should we adopt it? To take it upon faith has all the defects of\nfideism without its advantage (of being a minimal concession). For the sake of the\nargument, let us agree to prefer the modification that is the smallest concession to\nirrationalism. What is it? And is that preferable to the original fideist view? And\nworse, how are we to adjudicate on this without begging the question? Still worse,\nwhatever answer to this question that we may offer, will it not remain fideist at heart?\nBartley acutely observed that when Popper said that his proposal (to takes the\nfaith in reason on faith) is a deviation from rationalism, he was in error (or at the very\nleast unclear): the deviation is from classical, not from critical rationalism: applied to\nitself, classical rationalism does not live by its own precepts (it begs the question);\napplied to itself, critical rationalism may live by its own precepts, at least possibly so.\nSo far this criticism of Bartley is obviously right, and Popper should have\nacknowledged its validity. Unfortunately this did not happen. Partly it was Popper\u2019s\nfailing, partly it was a confusion that rested on the fact that Bartley had his own view\nof critical rationalism that Popper had all the right to reject \u2013 but not before admitting\nthe validity of Bartley\u2019s criticism.\nFor my own part, I am no party to this dispute [Agassi, 1981, 72, 100, 465-71,\n474, 476]. My aim here is not to take sides but to clarify it and perhaps to remove the\nvery ground for it. I reject the framework within which it takes place. My alternative\nto that framework is the idea that rationalism is a working hypothesis. Thus it is\nneither a basis for rational thought nor an object of faith, but simply an assumption\nthat facilitate rational deliberations. It seems to me that on second thought both\nPopper and Bartley would have agreed. They could object that I have not said what\nrational deliberation is, but here I defer to their own views on it, which are quite\ntraditional and also sufficiently unproblematic to serve as the default option.\nMy effort to neutralize a dispute may sound like an exercise in the tradition of\nlogical positivism. It is not. For, it replaces a metaphysical framework with a better\none, and it does not destroy a problem but replaces it with a better alternative, much\nin the tradition of critical rationalism. Thus, needless to say, I ascribe my alternative\nto Popper and Bartley and take their input as either propaedeutic (preparatory) or the\nlong way around, as you like it.\n1. The hyper-stable working hypothesis\nWhat characterizes a working hypothesis most is its fluidity: there is no commitment\nand hardly any reason to it: its adoption is for a lark. One may even take it on a whim,\nthough on occasion it is common sense. And what one takes on a whim is ephemeral,\nof course. Still, some working hypotheses stay, for good reasons or bad. My concern\nis with a working hypothesis that is hyper-stable. So let me show first that these exist.\nMy claim is that this stability is the most general characteristic of any reasonable\nview of duty. So please be patient.\nWe act voluntarily yet under constraints. Classical liberal thinkers often said,\nin principle there is no difference between free and coerced action. Nevertheless, one\ndifference matters, between keenness and reluctance: we may act reluctantly out of a\nsense of duty. Of course, classical liberal thinkers viewed duty-bound conduct as not\npeculiar, as it is up to us to decide to behave morally, so that we always act\nvoluntarily. Nevertheless, the difference between the fulfillment of one\u2019s own\ninterest and that of others is a matter of principle. This is particularly so in cases of\nacts with unlikely consequences. When we face options that are not likely to yield\nfruits, we tend to adopt choices that are easiest: the game is not worth the candle, we\nmay say to ourselves and quit. Yet when the game is obligatory, this is unacceptable.\nMany moral acts are unlikely to have worthy consequences, yet were that a sufficient\nexcuse for quitting a task allows us to be socially apathetic and even asocial. When it\ncomes to affairs of other people and more so to public affairs, as the duty of hope we\nshould grant the Good Lord the benefit of doubt [Agassi, 1999, 50-4, 124-5]. In our\nown affairs we may be more realistic. Hence, whereas optimism as an opinion is\nfoolish, as an attitude it is just right and often even obligatory.\nThis is a peculiarity of action out of duty as opposed to one out of self-interest,\nand so classical liberal theory is wanting. Its error rested, indeed, on an optimist\nassessment of the outcome of the broad application of rationality: optimist\nassessments prevent the appearance of the difference in attitude that morality\nprescribes between satisfying the personal interests and those of others . World War II\nexposed this optimism as an error. It matters not whether the error was in the\nassessment of the ease with which rationality would be broadly applicable or in the\nassessment of its outcome. What matters is that the optimist assessment of the\noutcome of our actions is no longer the default option, and that it should stay\nnonetheless as an assumption for our actions \u2013 as a stable working hypothesis.\nA dreadful example for this is the conduct of the Jewish leadership, especially\nthe Zionist leadership in the United States of America during the Holocaust. They\nsabotaged efforts to rescue the Jews of Europe [Agassi, 1999, Ch. 15]. Now they say,\nthey knew these efforts were hopeless. This is a mere excuse, not only because\nrecords available now refute this assessment, but also and more so because a priori\nsuch assessments may be false. Still, admittedly, at the time the assessment was bleak\nand it was reasonable (though erroneous). This example may be poor. This is of little\nconsequence, since alternative examples are easily available.\nThe hypothesis that we may make a difference should serve as a hyper-stable\nworking hypothesis. It is my alternative to the ideas of Popper and of Bartley about\nthe choice of a theory of rationality. Let me explain.\n2. Between Classical Rationalism and Fideism\nThe starting point here, to repeat, is the admission of the skeptical criticism of the\nclassical theory of rationality: proof is impossible. Advocates of irrationalis m often\nuse this criticism as the rationale for their rejection of all theories of rationality and\nof all proposal and demand to behave rationally. Those who reject the classical\ntheory but wish to adopt another add some adjective to the name of the theory of\nrationality to differentiate it from a theory that they might endorse. The adjectives\noften used are &#34;traditional&#34;, &#34;classical&#34; and &#34;Cartesian&#34;; Karl Popper suggested\n&#34;comprehensive&#34;, since the classical version advocates the comprehensive demand to\naffirm no view ever except proven ones.\nBeing comprehensive, classical rationalism demands to jettison all of familiar\nideas, so that the learning venture should begin afresh with no assumptions, with a\nclean slate, and with utterly open minds. In brief, classical rationalism is radical.\nDescartes attempted to apply it in his celebrated thought experiment, performed in\nthe hope that starting afresh guarantees the establishment of a true, scientific image\nof the world. He failed, as did all of his disciples.\nThe classical theory of rationality bumps into two interlocking standard\nobjections. The first is the classical skeptical argument: proof is question-begging.\nAn obvious logical way to overcome this is by the admission of some sufficiently\nstrong initial basic axiom. The standard examples are, the principle of the simplicity\nof nature, or of limited variety, or of induction. Some other axioms are available as\nwell. Their adherents defend their choices with a new argument that exposes the\ncomprehensiveness of classical rationalism as further weakness: the principle,\nwhatever it is, requires the assumption that it suffices for the development of a\nrational worldview and of science as we know it. This added assumption repeatedly\nmeets with a refutation that exposes the proposed principle as not good enough.\nConsider then the opposite extreme: irrationalism. Its advocates recommend\ngiving up rationality; this fascinates those who find the irrational attractive, appealing,\noverpowering: they are tired of rationality. They are intentionally unreasonable,\nforgetting that the intellect is the most powerful instrument that Nature has put at the\ndisposal of humanity, and the refusal to use it is lamentable. The advantage of\nunreason, however, is that it is license for the use of poor arguments. Those who use\nthis license denounce logic as perverse, as opposed to human natural healthy instincts,\nor to tradition or to traditional religion, or to whatever else they may advance as\nsuperior to reason. Yet, as a mere working hypothesis, this reveals some interesting\nideas. Prominent among these is the view of the first irrationalist, Heraclitus, the\nfamous pre-Socratic thinker, who probably reacted to the first version of rationalism,\nthat of Parmenides. Plato's Socrates called irrationalists mysologists, the haters of\nlogic (Phaido). Despite this hatred Heraclitus offered some valuable criticism of\nrationalism and some new ideas. Nevertheless, here let us dismiss misology.\nIrrationalists need not giving up the use of the intellect. Its use does not require\nany recognition of it as an authority over all thought processes \u2013 it can be useful\nwithout being authoritative in any way. Hence, irrationalists may have a choice in\nspecifying what portion of their thought process the intellect is not to control, as long\nas the choice does not intervene with their ability to use logic, even with a vengeance,\nin areas deemed well within the province of reason, such as mathematics and physics\nand their practical applications. What then is the suggestion to limit rationality?\nWhere exactly does rationality cease to adjudicate? The irrationalist literature has\nmany answers to this question that serve well as merely working hypotheses.\nThe better of the disenchanted with classical rationalism distinguish between\nthe criticism of the classical theory of rationality that all of them endorse and the idea\non which they disagree as to what to place outside the domain of the intellect. They\nrightly insist that the latter is less important than the former, since it leads them to\nagree that some presupposition, no matter what, must obtain with no rational basis,\nno matter upon what other kind of basis it might rest; indeed, they may add, one may\nendorse quite arbitrarily any presupposition as the initial basic axiom for rationality.\nSome presuppositions are so useless that they are overlooked. (For example, the\nassertion that Superman exists will be obviously utterly useless here.) They\nadvocated arbitrary presuppositions are usually far from being satisfactory too, but as\nworking hypotheses they may be handy and when one fails its advocate may abandon\nit for another. Of course, being irrationalists they may also cling to it dogmatically.\nAn example of this dogmatism is collectivism, made popular by \xc9mile\nDurkheim, one of the two acknowledged fathers of modern sociology. Most\nirrationalists endorse collectivism dogmatically, despite its obvious defects; they take\nas their initial basic axiom tradition, religious or national, or some authority,\nintellectual or political, or any other item that they declare vital for the maintenance\nof social stability. Their basic axiom then is that society with no stability is too\nobjectionable to take seriously into consideration as a viable option. This is sad, but\nthere are sad options on the opposite side too, namely on the side of individualism.\nAs a stable working hypothesis this is very common in the social sciences. It is\nespecially popular as Max Weber, the other of the two acknowledged fathers of\nmodern sociology. He took as the initial basic axiom for rationality a personal faith.\nThis is the source of the label \u201cfideism\u201d (&#34;fideo&#34; means, I believe). Advocates of\nfideism stress the logical impossibility of rationalism as long as it is comprehensive,\nand the need to choose an initial basic axiom in order to reinstate it. Assuming\nnothing, one has no reason to activate the project of developing rationalism and a\nrational worldview. This is the so-called &#34;the tu-quoque argument&#34; (meaning, you\ntoo): comprehensive rationalism is impossible, therefore, rationalism too rests on an\ninitial basic axiom, namely, that rationality is at all possible and desirable.\nRather than ask, what did Weber use for proof, let us examine the tu-quoque\nargument. Supposing that it is valid; does this support fideism? Does it exonerate the\nutter arbitrariness (absence of logic) of the choice of an initial basic axiom? It does\nnot sound right. Most advocates of fideism believe in their tradition and Weber hated\ntradition and expressed faith in science. This observation is so obvious that we must\nascribe its neglect to its being taken for granted: of course, the initial basic axiom has\nto be sufficiently rich in content to enable it to save rationalism from its initial\npredicament. That we take this constraint for granted is obvious, yet the systematic\nneglect of its articulation is a remiss, since there is an obvious need to specify its\nfeatures and discuss them. Now, how should we decide whether our chosen initial\nbasic axiom is strong enough? Should it perhaps also be not too strong? And then,\neven if we find that our chosen axiom is strong enough but not too strong, then we\nmay ask, is it unique? If it is, then we can eschew fideism even in the light of the tu-\nquoque argument \u2013 as unnecessary: the constraint to classical rationalism imposed on\nit by the tu-quoque argument then leaves no room for any arbitrariness and it then\nbecomes eminently rational as the most efficient means to rescue rationality.\nThis move is very welcome, as it dispenses with the most undesirable corollary\nto fideism, namely, the claim that there are different and equally legitimate kinds of\nrationalism, depending on one's pre-logical choice of one's initial basic axiom, and\nthat the validity of each is constrained by its alternatives. What is said here may be\ntrue or false, but it is a way out of the predicament of classical rationalism that is not\nfideist in the usual sense of the word, as it employs the tu-quoque argument without\nconceding the arbitrary choice of any axiom.\nThe undesirable corollary just mentioned was praised by the great fideist and\nmystic anthropologist Sir Edward Evans-Pritchard as most desirable. This makes his\nfideism not so arbitrary. Any defense of the choice of an initial basic axiom will then\nbe rational. And then it is better to take as the initial basic axiom Russell's celebrated\nproposal.  Another proposal, perhaps even better, was introduced by Popper in\nChapter 24 of his classic The Open Society and Its Enemies of 1945: the belief that\ncriticism bespeaks progress. He called this &#34;the faith in reason&#34; and characterized it\nas the minimal required deviation from comprehensive rationalism. Russell hoped\nthat his a priori supposition would permit reinstatement of classical rationalism in\nsome attenuation; Popper offered a fully-fledged new theory of rationality as\ndisproof. If any suggestion for an initial basic axiom is acceptable, then a theory of\nrationality is possible such that it is neither classical nor fideist, and this regardless of\nwhether the proof or disproof is taken to be the criterion of rationality. The claim is\nthat the arbitrariness of the initial choice does not follow from the tu-quoque\nargument, so that it can be made quite rationally.\nIf classical rationalism is to be fully restored, however, it is not enough to\nqualify it rationally: proof has to be shown possible. If it is, then an example will\nestablish this possibility. Is there any? It is easy to adduce proofs, and even of diverse\nkinds, mathematical, scientific, and legal: for convictions in murder trials evidence\nshould establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and at times it is declared achieved.\nSkeptics and advocates of fideism admit that such proofs exist. The question is the\nsame as, would such proofs be acceptable to Descartes as valid? We do not quite\nknow what kind of proof would satisfy Descartes, and probably he himself did not\nknow that either. To restrict the discussion to mathematics will not do; he would not\nagree to this. Also, this would not help as controversy still surrounds the question,\nwhat are proofs in mathematics? Descartes did offer a criterion for valid proof, but it\nis unclear and by now abandoned. To be clear about what valid proof comprises, a\ntheory of proof is required. But then, naturally, whatever this theory will turn out to\nbe, it will be question-begging. It is this very observation that led to the ancient\nskeptic conclusion that proof is impossible. Hence [classical] rationality, too, is\nimpossible. So, the followers of Pyrrho, the Pyrrhonists, suggested that one should\nnever adopt any view, that one should always suspend judgment. Fideism is not any\nphilosophy that takes some initial axiom for granted: most philosophies do so.\nFideism is the endorsement of the skeptical critique of classical rationalism as\nlogically unassailable, plus the refusal to abide by the proposal to suspend all\njudgments or the observation that no one can follow this proposal. Advocates of\nfideism declare the only way out of skepticism the initial endorsement of some basic\naxiom prior to the acceptance of the rationalist canons of proof. Taking this last\nsentence seriously one may see that whether the proposals of Russell and of Popper\nare satisfactory or not, they have unquestionably rendered a great service by refuting\nthis fideist assertion: feasible or not, they show the existence of alternatives that are\nnot as arbitrary. They have thus sensitized us to the inconsistency of the advocates of\nfideism who defend their initial basic axioms, and even without stating them\nexplicitly.\n2. Between Fideism and Critical Rationalism\nThe question, which axiom to endorse, seems to advocates of fideism beside the\npoint: as the choice of an initial basic axiom is arbitrary in the sense that (for logical\nreasons) it is pre-rational and so not rational. Here some doubt as to the sincerity of\ncontrary notwithstanding.\nadvocates of fideism may be raised: how come they usually endorse the faith of their\nfathers, whatever this happens to be? They retort that this choice is the most\nconvenient. This sounds as if convenience is the supreme criterion of choice.\nMoreover, which choice is more convenient invites the investigations that they\nforego. One may try for comfort different initial basic axioms one after the other:\ntake as an initial axiom the thesis that repetition renders choice progressively\nintelligent and reasonable. This kind of conduct, and the decision to adopt it, is\nrational. The best variant of fideism, then, the one closest to the fideist own mode of\nreasoning, is to make a basic decision afresh each day. Advocates of fideism may\nreject this as it is inconvenient, but then, criteria for convenience as well as feels for\nit are no initial axioms and so they can be overruled. To conclude, even if fideism is\ntrue and an arbitrary choice of some initial axiom is required, it need not be final.\nSome existentialist philosophers say that a commitment to an initial axiom that is not\nlife-long is not serious. But to take seriousness as more compelling than intellectual\nprogress makes it one's initial basic axiom, and an inadmissible one at that, since it\nruns contrary to logic by blocking all criticism. Admitting this, however, demands\nthat every candidate for initial basic axiom should prove irrefutable.\nAdvocates of fideism ignore the range of choice of initial axioms to employ as\nthe basis of rational thought, possibly because most of them are traditionalists and\nonce they succeed to reconcile their traditional faith with rationalism they are content.\nIf so, then this is their initial basic axiom: they are traditionalists and rationalists. Is\ntheir choice arbitrary? Some of them endorse their traditions without examination;\nothers defend them in the name of social stability, and of these, Evans -Pritchard and\nothers, conclude that different traditions hold for different societies. They defend\nrationalism while rejecting the classical Cartesian hostility to tradition.\nAll this is conjecture, which is thus suspect, especially since finding any\nrationale to the fideist initial basic axiom deprives it of its arbitrariness and so of its\nvery fideism. But then, whenever advocates of fideism argue for their fusion of\ntradition and reason, they do so by defending their initial basic axiom \u2500 as arbitrary\nor otherwise \u2500 they are advocates of fideism no longer.\nMost non-religious advocates of fideism are pragmatists; they advocate faith in\nscience for practical reasons. This invites a careful distinction between pragmatists\nproper and pragmatist advocates of fideism: the former view usefulness as the basic\ncriterion for belief in any opinion; they deem utility the ground of belief: according\nto them rationality is not proof but usefulness. Hence, like Popper, they offer a non-\nclassical, theory of rationality and so they are not advocates of fideism at all. Hence,\nthe best criticism of pragmatism proper is the observation that in order to decide what\nidea is useful we need some workable criterion of rational decision between the\noptions that the choice of this or that hypothesis is most useful. Advocates of fideism\ndo not claim that utility or any other criterion is a criterion of rationality; rather, they\ntake it as the initial basic axiom that is chosen prior to being rational, as the\nprecondition for it; other than that, they adhere to the classical view of rationality as\nproof, and so the strong criticism of pragmatism just voiced does not apply to their\nview. One may, of course, suggest that the initial choice of rationality is not useful,\nbut this is an initial basic axiom, a dogma not subject to critical debate.\nToday taking science to be the most useful set of beliefs to advocate is\nextremely popular. Its popularity suggests that possibly behind it stands mental\nlaziness plus the hypothesis that following the majority is most convenient. This is no\nfideism. Nor is the thoughtless adherence to the majority view, nor is the view of one\nwho has never examined one\u2019s views and who does not know what exactly it is. It\nmay but need not be fideist proper. It is clear that these differ; the question is, does\nthis difference make a practical difference? A difference, to be a [real] difference,\nsaid arch-pragmatist William James, must make a [practical] difference. Is there a\npractical difference between pragmatism proper and pragmatist fideism?\nAt least this should be observed: the tu-quoque argument makes it clear that\nthose who use it view us all as advocates of fideism at heart, whether we know it or\nnot; and then even if everyone behave in the fideist manner, the advocates of fideism\nare still practically better off as they possess a greater self-awareness. But surely,\nwhether this is so or not is both forever question-begging and empirically decidable,\nwhich is absurd.\nPragmatists have replaced proof with utility as the criterion of rationality.\nOther criteria may be proof-substitutes too. Each of them may serve as an alternative\nto the classical theory of rationality or as a fideist basis for the quasi-classical one.\nThis depicts the whole scheme in a new way. For, now the question is generalized:\npragmatists or others who take utility or any other quality as their supreme criterion,\ndo they use it repeatedly and eschew proof proper, or do they use it initially and then\nrequire proof? Is theirs an alternative rationalist view or is it a quasi-rationalist one?\nThis is a big difference, as it is procedural and so it effects almost every deliberation:\ndeliberations may employ proof (though on the basis of an arbitrarily chosen axiom)\nand they may employ an altogether different criterion of rationality.\nThis reasoning may expose pragmatism as a version of fideism; it also exposes\nadvocates of fideism as rationalists for all intents and purpose, as long their initial\nbasic choice of rationalism is not challenged. Their discussions can, perhaps also\nshould, be scrutinized as to whether or not, in addition to their axioms, advocates of\nfideism usually advocate the demand for proof. Now, clearly, almost all discussions\nincorporate some initial hypotheses, except for Descartes' radical thought experiment\nand its alternatives, all of which are now judged unavoidably failures. Hence, there is\nno practical difference between the fideist mode of arguing and other, except for one:\nwhenever what they happen to consider their initial basic axioms happens to be\nchallenged, they refuse to discuss it. Here, all of a sudden, the tu-quoque argument\nbreaks down and drops out of the picture. Contrary to it, there is a basic difference\nbetween the fideist and others: we all exempt some dogma from the demand to\nexamine it rationally, but the advocates of fideism exempt their own dogma\nconsciously and systematically and for good. This is a great self-awareness, and one\nthat they might naturally take pride of. It turns out to be their awareness of their\nirrevocable commitment to a dogma, and as a necessity. But this turns out to be a\nmistake: there are better ways to handle the situation.\nThe very use of the tu-quoque argument rests on error: it is used as an excuse\nto exempt from rational scrutiny some unspecified view, on the basis of the\nobservation that usually we all do so (since the skeptic critique of classical\nrationalism is valid). But we all do so now and then, whereas advocates of fideism do\nso come-what-may. This is why the suggestion to keep one's initial axiom floating is\nso deadly to fideism; its hidden assumption is that their retreat to commitment is a\nleap of faith in the sense of Kierkegaard, as Bartley has discovered.\nBartley saw the situation this way: taking the tu-quoque argument as support\nfor fideism is placing it on the borderline between rationalism and irrationalism and\ninvites efforts to refute it: its refutation is required not for irrationalists but for\nrationalists. He was in error: the tu-quoque argument is but a variant on the skeptic\ncritique. Even were it unanswerable, it would remain better to take reason upon faith\nthan to be defensive about some proper dogma. This point belongs to Popper. It is\nlovely. In his effort to dodge Bartley\u2019s criticism he lost it. pity.\nThis is no defense of classical rationalism, of course, since the skeptic critique\nof it as question-begging is taken here as valid, even if only as a working hypothesis;\nthis is to dismiss the fideist critique as no boost for it. This dismissal holds equally\nfor classical rationalism and to any other variant. To make this evident, let us\nconsider the idea of the ancient Pyrrhonist school, the view that one can live w ithout\nadherence to any view, with total and permanent suspension of judgment, and that\nthe practice of the suspension of judgment provides peace of mind (ataraxia). This is\nquestionable, but let this ride and let us ask, is Pyrrhonism fideist? Possibly, as a\nmatter of fact, every school has an initial basic axiom. Even were this true, as neither\nschool has noted this, it is hard to decide which of the two schools is nearer to\nfideism, the Pyrrhonists or the classical rationalists. That there is a great practical\ndifference between them, however, is all too clear. Hence, the tu-quoque argument\nmakes no practical difference even between skeptics and classical rationalists, though\nthe skeptical argument clearly does.\nI know Popper and Bartle agreed that they d isagreed; I do not know on what.\nPerhaps Popper has offered a new comprehensive theory of rationality that is less\nquestion-begging than comprehensive classical rationalism, perhaps not; Bartley\nclaimed that he did and that Popper did not; but then perhaps both did and perhaps\nneither did. If both did, and if both did not, are the views of the two identical? For\nuncontested background information, the very demand for openness to criticism is\ntaken for granted. Popper\u2019s innovation that Bartley endorsed but that is still the\nminority view is the assertion that this demand suffices for rationality, including the\nrationality of science. Popper's theory of rationality is very far-reaching, and is far\nfrom obvious. Bartley found it admirable but defective in not being comprehensive.\n3. Between Popper and Bartley\nscience Adolf Gr\xfcnbaum who calls himself neo-Baconian and denies Popper his originality.\nWhereas classical rationalism broke down because it is comprehensive, fideism is\npainful because it is not. Hence, rejecting both amounts to rejectingwhat they share:\nthe idea that rationality is proof. Consider, then, critical rationalism, the idea that\nrationality is disproof. Can we not show both options of it, qualified and\ncomprehensive, likewise painful? Can we apply the skeptical argument to\ncomprehensive critical rationalism and find it wanting, and then to apply the\nrationalist critique of fideism to qualified critical rationalism, and then be done with\nit altogether? Let me defeat this program.\nConsider first the application of classical rationalism to critical rationalism\n(qualified or comprehensive). This way critical rationalism fails of course. This has\nbeen showed repeatedly in the literature, yet it is trivial. Moreover, this is offered as\nfatal criticism, yet it is no criticism at all: there is no reason why critical rationalism\nshould submit to the rules of classical rationalism. Should it be applied to itself\ninstead? That classical rationalism should be proven by its own light is clear. But\ncritical rationalism should be held open to criticism, perhaps, or else it should be\nqualified. Here possibly Popper and Bartley disagreed. What is the reasoning here?\nCan we discuss this matter without begging the question?\nThe claim that logic is obligatory is inherent in the history of the debate over\nrationality. Hence, it is not contested that the aim of criticism is to refute its object.\nFrom the very start Popper stressed that he never adjudicated the matter of the\nsuccess of each piece of criticism, that all he said in general was no more than what\nlogic requires: if and when a piece of criticism is judged successful, then it is thereby\nalso judged as having refuted its object. To repeat, Popper offers as a solution to the\nproblem of rationality not a logical truth, but a conjecture, the novel theory that\ndisproof suffices for the advancement of knowledge in general and of science in\nparticular. How does he know that disproof suffices? He does not; it is his conjecture.\nQuery: is it rational to advocate this presupposition, this initial basic axiom? Can\nthere be a critical debate of it? If not, it seems fideist; if yes, it seems comprehensive.\nWhich is it?\nAssume that we must choose some initial basic axiom; how can the choice be\nrational? Given Popper's theory of rationality as openness to criticism, the answer to\nthis question is obvious: to the extent that it is criticizable and open to criticism, it is.\nDoes this apply to Popper's own choice? Should a critical rationalist be open-minded\nabout being open-minded? This is hard to say. Let us try to do so by splitting critical\nrationalism into two theses, one minor, one major, so that the question splits into two\nas well. The minor thesis is that criticism is binding. Is it? In other words, is logic\nbinding? The major thesis is that disproof suffices for intellectual progress. Is it? Till\nnow adherence to logic was taken for granted; nevertheless, possibly, comprehensive\ncritical rationalism requires an examination of our commitment to logic.\nAlready Plato asked, how binding is logic? In the end of his Phaedo,\ndescribing Socrates' last minutes, he ascribes to him the refusal to give up reason;\nnothing, Socrates seems to say, will sway him away from logic: he will never be a\nmysologist: even in his last hour he will gladly accept criticism. It is hard to say\nwhether this reading of the text is right, since the question is intricate. But Popper's\ntext seemed to me clear enough \u2500 until he declared Bartley's reading of it erroneous:\nI then began to doubt my reading of his text. For a lark, however, let me cling to my\nold reading of his text, as examining a view is more important than its authorship.\n(Besides, the first author of qualified critical rationalism is anyway Plato or Heinrich\nHeine.) To avoid all misconception of my motive, let me repeat: this discussion is no\ndefense of Popper or of Bartley, since I dissent from both.\nPlato's insistence on open-mindedness, his refusal to be open-minded about it,\nseems to identify rationality with logic. This is not clear, especially since formal\nlogic was invented later, and since it was not satisfactory till the twentieth century, if\never. So logic was open to criticism. Is it still? If yes, can its authority be revoked? In\nother words, can there be a critical debate on the rationality of logic, and if it is found\ndefective, can it be taken for granted? This depends on what we mean by the demand\nto reject a refuted version of it. If it is the demand to improve logic, then yes; if it is\nthe demand to jettison it, then no. Hence, in the broad sense logic is not given to\nrational deliberations, and so it is the initial axiom of rationality. Yet, in the narrow\nsense logic is very much given to rational deliberations, and this is expressed in the\nperennial efforts to improve it. (This seems to be the major thrust of the critique of\nthe view of logic as above criticism that we usually ascribe to Van Quine.)\nThis holds for all possible versions of the theory of rationality, since, to repeat,\ndiscussion of it was always conducted within logic. And then, Popper's claim that\nrationality is not comprehensive can be seen (not as a concession to fideism but) as\nmaking explicit a point that was traditionally taken for granted and that the modern\nhistory of logic makes its explicit statement desirable: the broad commitment to logic\ninvites efforts at its improvement in detail. Once this is noted, the discussion of\ncomprehensiveness has to be recast in a more precise manner. For example, the\nadvocates of fideism' commitment to their tradition is less irrational if it is only a\nbroad commitment, while being open-minded about any detail of it. (This is no small\ndifference, as it replaces the refusal to engage in intellectual traffic between different\ntraditions with a proposal to have it, at least up to a point, but the point is movable.)\nPopper has advocated this attitude to tradition in his classic if neglected 1947\n&#34;Towards a Rational Theory of Tradition&#34; [Popper, 1963].\nWith more due care, then, Bartley's comprehensiveness may read, his\ncommitment to logic is rational since he is open to its critical assessment. The same\nholds for Popper, of course. Where, then, is the difference between qualified and\ncomprehensive critical rationalism? Perhaps the difference lies in the disagreement\nabout the major thesis, the thesis that the engagement in critical debates suffices for\nthe advancement of learning. Since criticism involves logic, the discussion of the\nmajor thesis involves the minor one, but we need not go over this ground again.\nSuppose that the thesis that criticism suffices for progress is refuted, then. What will\nthis suggest to critical rationalists? Again, it seems, it will invite an improvement, not\na total overthrow. This seems to be the attitude advocated and practiced by both\nattitudes. So how do they differ?\nThis is not an idle thought. Critical rationalism was criticized both ways: once\n\u2500 by Feyerabend and myself \u2500 with the observation that at times the suspension of\ncriticism (at least for a lark) is wise (as Popper admitted citing Galileo to that effect)\nand once \u2500 by myself \u2500 with the observation that scholasticism was critical but not\nprogressive. The reason for this defect is clear: scholastic criticism was conducted\nwithin a given framework that was not given to criticism; this was done consciously,\non the ground of the view that debates have to be limited by some initial basic axio m,\nvery much in the fideist manner. Popper was aware of this: in his early work he\ndemanded that the most theory most given to criticism should be examined first, and\nhe later criticized the scholastic theory, which he called &#34;the myth of the framework&#34;.\nHe was thus unclear if not inconsistent. The way to overcome the inconsistency is to\nspeak of maximal criticism instead of criticism when wording the thesis of critical\nrationalism. Popper suggested that the demand for maximal openness to criticism\nwill eliminate, or at least sufficiently prevent, the use of ad hoc hypotheses, as there\nreduce the level of openness to criticism of hypotheses.\nExcept that this was criticized too \u2500 also by myself. Many theories in\ntechnology are very open to criticism yet are very much ad hoc; efforts to put them to\ntest are made repeatedly, as they are of great technological value. Yet they are not\ndeemed intellectually as interesting as the scarcely testable theories that are on the\nforefront of theoretical research. Since critical rationalism does not differentiate\nbetween pure and applied research, it demands improvement. This holds for Popper\nand for Bartley equally.\nSince qualified critical rationalism demands openness to criticism not only in\nthe abstract but also as exhibited in the possibility of a concrete criticism, in the high\nrisk of the theory in question, Bartley could ask Popper, how great should this risk be\nbefore it is deemed great enough? Popper had an answer to this question already in\n1935, but only as far as science is concerned: the risk is measured there by the\nlikelihood of an experiment that can be designed and performed to refute the theory\nin question; this likelihood can be measured by some extant alternative or by\ncommon sense. But Popper himself admitted in 1945 that weaker kinds of criticism\nare possible, in history and in philosophy, including ethics. How much should the\nrisk be a real one? (Significantly, Bartley took seriously the weak criticism that\npseudo-intellectual sects directed against the established commonwealth of learning.\nHe suggested [Bartley, 1990, 100] that since the academy is so very dogmatic, these\nfleeting intellectual clusters are where the action really is. This view is intriguing but\nalas not serious.) Nor is that all. Popper spent much of his effort arguing that\ncriticism is beneficial, which should be incontestable, and that the theory of\nrationality as the critical attitude does not suffer from the skeptical critique. Bartley\non his part spent much time arguing that since critical rationalism is not hit by the\nskeptic critique it can be held comprehensively. But they both argued prematurely,\noverlooking the critical examination of the claim that they perform the task for which\nthey were designed.\nThe question that the classical theory of rationality came to answer is, what\ntheory should be believed? Critical rationalists refuse to answer this question, as it\nprefers the diversity of opinions. Rather, it comes to exclude the theories that are not\nreasonable to believe, beginning with traditional local myths. The wish to promote\nthe progress of science is better than the wish to believe in current science. Proof\ndoes not do it; does disproof? No; critical rationalism never guaranteed success. Can\nit at least explain success? No; explanation amounts to guarantee: to say that A is\ncaused by B is to guarantee the presence of A in the presence of B. Critical\nrationalism guarantees not the success in providing conjectures and their criticism,\nbut that when these are present, progress obtains. How? The answer is what makes\ncritical rationalism so very intriguing: criticism is not the cause of intellectual\nprogress; it is intellectual progress. This, however, is a new conception of progress,\nand it can be challenged. We have not shed light this way on an important matter:\nwhy is the Popper-Bartley dispute important? In answer to this Bartley said,\nerroneously, because the tu-quoque argument is a serious challenge. This challenge\nmay signify at most for critical rationalism, not for science proper.\n4. Rationality as Partial and as Social\nWe see again that the discussion requires better presentation. Let us begin with\nrationality, whatever it is. Rationality as proof is an all-or-nothing affair; criticism is\npossibly more graded. Consider it a matter of degree. I. C. Jarvie and I have\nintroduced this idea decades ago. The measure of the degree of rationality, we\nsuggest, is not some abstract scale but depends on the available intellectual tools. It is\nclear, we said, that for one living in a preliterate society the most rational act and\nattitude will be much inferior to that available to one living in a society familiar with\nscience. This enters the social dimens ion into the debate, and so it really needs going\nover and, when necessary, recast. This is no small matter. Traditionally the options\navailable to social philosophy were individualism and collectivism. As collectivism\nnaturally distrusts individual reason as disruptive, it tends to be irrationalist.\nIndividualism then ruled the debate on rationality. And as individuals depend on\nsociety to this or that extent, though not wholly, their rationality should be cast in\nsocial terms and then viewed as partial.\nTo take a simple example, whereas traditional advocates of fideism discussed\nthe matter of rationality in an individualist framework, they could hardly answer the\nquestion, how should I choose my initial axioms? They did not have clear instances\nof initial axioms, and it looked as if infinitely many alternatives are available. Asking\nthe question in a social manner it becomes the question of the choice of a community,\nand there are a few communities to join; moreover, one cannot change communities\nevery week, and so, for merely technical reasons, one must live on one so as to\nacquire is basic tenets. It was stressed by Michael Polanyi, that when one joins a\ncommunity one scarcely knows what it has to offer, especially if the community in\nquestion is the scientific community, and that when one learns the initial basic\naxioms one may find that they are not given to simple articulation. He stressed,\nhowever, that one can belong to more than one community without fear of\ncontradiction. He did not elaborate. Another historical example should serve as\nevidence of the defect of the abstract discussion that Popper still participated in: the\nold scholastic tradition is not considered as rational as the new scientific tradition\n(even on the supposition that the old gave birth to the young). I skip the details here.\nAs long as science plays the role of a paradigm of rational activity, the\nindividual is most rational when joining the scientific community. Popper has\nsuggested that science is a social institution, one that encourages criticism. He also\nsuggested that parliamentary democracy is such a paradigm, and the same holds for\nthat paradigm. That there may be inconsistency between science and democracy, as\nwell as within each, is no reason for defection, as it may be a challenge for efforts to\nimprove. Popper said, the reason for these being paradigms of rationality is that\nrationality is the effort to improve through criticism.\nCan we rephrase the Popper-Bartley dispute within a social framework? All\ntheories of rationality recommend joining actively the life of science and of\ndemocracy. The view of rationality as improvable goes better with critical\nrationalism than with classical rationalism. Is here a significant difference between\nPopper and Bartley? Can we rephrase Bartley's philosophy socially? I do not know.\nThe critical attitude commends both a personal openness to criticism and an\ninstitutional setup that encourages criticism and is open to reform. The criticism of an\ninstitution, or of an institutionalized opinion, however, is not the same as the\ncriticism of an individual's opinion: the one is a personal matter, the other is social.\nValid criticism should always lead one to the search of alternatives, and reform is\naccepted not after criticism is voiced and endorsed but after a viable alternative is\nfound and tested in instituted manners. What this means for Popper is clear enough:\nboth democracy and science are open to reform. What does this mean for Bartley\nabove and beyond what it means to Popper I cannot see. Perhaps this means that\npossibly democracy and/or science will be criticized in a new manner that will lead\nto a proposal of a totally new regime and/or research protocol and Bartley will be\nwilling to test it. Whether this is so or not is hard to say: the discussion becomes too\nabstract here.\nBibliography\nAgassi, Joseph, 1981.

 u"Giuseppe Franco, editor, Der Kritische Rationalismus als Denkmethode und\nLebensweise: Festscrhift zum 90. Geburtstag von Hans Albert. Klagenfurt: Kitab,\n2012, 34-55\nCritical Rationalism, Comprehensive or Qualified:\nThe Popper-Bartley Dispute\nBy Joseph Agassi,\nTel-Aviv University and York University, Toronto\n0. Background.\nKarl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945,\nCh. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason.\nLater on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and\neven called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to\nhis annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave,\n1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter\nis very complicated. Let me show this now.\nFideism is a minimal retreat from classical rationalism. As this theory is\ncomprehensive in its demand for proof as ultimate justification, it begs the question\nof its own justification. All parties to the current dispute admit that this is a defect\nthat has no cure except by some modification. To that end adherents to fideism\nadvocate some axiom taken on faith as the minimum necessary concession to\nirrationalism. The rationalism that the advocates of fideism qualify is the classical\ntheory of rationality, that is, to be precise, an assertion plus a demand. The theory is,\nrationality equals proof. The demand is to make an assertion \u2013 or to endorse it, to\nbelieve it \u2013 if and only if proof is available that the assertion is true. As the skeptics\nhave shown, any proof of any (synthetic) assertion requires a proof theory that\nrequires proof in its turn. (The possibly of proof in logic and in mathematics has no\nplace in the present discussion.) The skeptics have then recommended holding no\nbelief, making no definite assertion, holding all views only tentatively. Skeptics\nclaim that they have a proof that no proof is possible that should satisfy classical\nrationalists. Most rationalists have invested much effort in attempts to find fault in\nthat proof, and they are still trying. As this essay concerns the dispute between\nPopper and Bartley, who both endorse the skeptic proof, we may take the skeptical\nproof for granted. Hence, the classical theory of rationality cannot stay as it is. The\nadvocates of fideism conclude, then, that some retreat is imperative. The minimal\ndeviation is an assertion that advocates of fideism recommend to endorse without\nproof. That is to say, they recommend its endorsement upon faith. There are two\nstandard candidates for that assertion: the principle of induction and the faith of one\u2019s\nforefathers.\nOf course, not all deviation from the classical theory of rationality is fideist.\nSince advocates of fideism propose that the deviation from the old view should be\nminimal, it is hard to see how this proposal is contestable. An obvious point to\ncontest concerns the question, what deviation is minimal. On this Popper has made a\nbrilliant alternative proposal. Although it has not gained popularity among advocates\nof fideism, it is obviously the best thus far offered. It is this. The least concession\nshould not be the faith in any principle of induction, much less in a given traditional\nfaith, but preferably in the possibility that rational debate may generate progress.\nAdvocates of fideism may object to this obviously superior proposal: it accompanies\na lower standard of rationality. Whereas the classical theory of rationality equates\nrationality with proof, Popper\u2019s theory equates rationality with the critical attitude.\nWhat is preferable, one irrational axiom or this reduction of the standard? The\nanswer is that the reduction of the standard is necessary anyway since the skeptical\ncriticism of traditional rationalism is valid. (Thus, Bertrand Russell advocated the\nadoption of some principle of induction upon faith in the hope that it will suffice to\njustify current science [Russell, 1992, 38]; [Russell, 1996, 313-28]. He did not\nmanage to formulate it explicitly.)\nPopper has proposed two brilliant minimizing moves: of the standard of\nrationality and of the concession to irrationalism. Bartley has shown that there is no\nneed for the two moves, as one will do. This he proved conclusively: reducing the\nstandard of rationality renders a concession unnecessary. It is a shame that Popper\nhas not admitted this, suggesting instead that Bartley just improved the wording of\nwhat he had intended to advocate all along: he denied that he made the mistake that\nBartley had attributed to him. It is likewise a shame that Bartley conflated his valid\ncriticism of Popper with his own alternative to it: only the criticism, not the\nalternative to the criticized theory, is uncontestable. The errors on both sides led to an\nimpasse. In desperation, Bartley called Popper a fideist, and Popper took offence. My\naim here is to rectify these two errors and thus restore the peace between their ghosts.\nNow the fideism that Bartley has saddled Popper with is at the very least not\nthe traditional version but an improvement on it. It says, welcome critical scrutiny as\nprogressive. If this is a version of fideism, then it is an admirable version of it. Both\nPopper and Bartley have confused this idea, be it a version of fideism or not, with a\nslightly greater demand: do not advocate a theory unless it has passed critical\nscrutiny. This version of rationalism, be it fideist or not, both Popper and Bartley\nrejected, and rightly so, despite its superiority over the more traditional versions of\nfideism. Regrettably they did not praise it before rejecting it, although by the canons\nof criticism they should have.\nTaking for granted here the skeptical criticism of traditional rationalism, let us\nconsider the question, which modification of it is right? Considering any proposed\nmodification, why should we adopt it? To take it upon faith has all the defects of\nfideism without its advantage (of being a minimal concession). For the sake of the\nargument, let us agree to prefer the modification that is the smallest concession to\nirrationalism. What is it? And is that preferable to the original fideist view? And\nworse, how are we to adjudicate on this without begging the question? Still worse,\nwhatever answer to this question that we may offer, will it not remain fideist at heart?\nBartley acutely observed that when Popper said that his proposal (to takes the\nfaith in reason on faith) is a deviation from rationalism, he was in error (or at the very\nleast unclear): the deviation is from classical, not from critical rationalism: applied to\nitself, classical rationalism does not live by its own precepts (it begs the question);\napplied to itself, critical rationalism may live by its own precepts, at least possibly so.\nSo far this criticism of Bartley is obviously right, and Popper should have\nacknowledged its validity. Unfortunately this did not happen. Partly it was Popper\u2019s\nfailing, partly it was a confusion that rested on the fact that Bartley had his own view\nof critical rationalism that Popper had all the right to reject \u2013 but not before admitting\nthe validity of Bartley\u2019s criticism.\nFor my own part, I am no party to this dispute [Agassi, 1981, 72, 100, 465-71,\n474, 476]. My aim here is not to take sides but to clarify it and perhaps to remove the\nvery ground for it. I reject the framework within which it takes place. My alternative\nto that framework is the idea that rationalism is a working hypothesis. Thus it is\nneither a basis for rational thought nor an object of faith, but simply an assumption\nthat facilitate rational deliberations. It seems to me that on second thought both\nPopper and Bartley would have agreed. They could object that I have not said what\nrational deliberation is, but here I defer to their own views on it, which are quite\ntraditional and also sufficiently unproblematic to serve as the default option.\nMy effort to neutralize a dispute may sound like an exercise in the tradition of\nlogical positivism. It is not. For, it replaces a metaphysical framework with a better\none, and it does not destroy a problem but replaces it with a better alternative, much\nin the tradition of critical rationalism. Thus, needless to say, I ascribe my alternative\nto Popper and Bartley and take their input as either propaedeutic (preparatory) or the\nlong way around, as you like it.\n1. The hyper-stable working hypothesis\nWhat characterizes a working hypothesis most is its fluidity: there is no commitment\nand hardly any reason to it: its adoption is for a lark. One may even take it on a whim,\nthough on occasion it is common sense. And what one takes on a whim is ephemeral,\nof course. Still, some working hypotheses stay, for good reasons or bad. My concern\nis with a working hypothesis that is hyper-stable. So let me show first that these exist.\nMy claim is that this stability is the most general characteristic of any reasonable\nview of duty. So please be patient.\nWe act voluntarily yet under constraints. Classical liberal thinkers often said,\nin principle there is no difference between free and coerced action. Nevertheless, one\ndifference matters, between keenness and reluctance: we may act reluctantly out of a\nsense of duty. Of course, classical liberal thinkers viewed duty-bound conduct as not\npeculiar, as it is up to us to decide to behave morally, so that we always act\nvoluntarily. Nevertheless, the difference between the fulfillment of one\u2019s own\ninterest and that of others is a matter of principle. This is particularly so in cases of\nacts with unlikely consequences. When we face options that are not likely to yield\nfruits, we tend to adopt choices that are easiest: the game is not worth the candle, we\nmay say to ourselves and quit. Yet when the game is obligatory, this is unacceptable.\nMany moral acts are unlikely to have worthy consequences, yet were that a sufficient\nexcuse for quitting a task allows us to be socially apathetic and even asocial. When it\ncomes to affairs of other people and more so to public affairs, as the duty of hope we\nshould grant the Good Lord the benefit of doubt [Agassi, 1999, 50-4, 124-5]. In our\nown affairs we may be more realistic. Hence, whereas optimism as an opinion is\nfoolish, as an attitude it is just right and often even obligatory.\nThis is a peculiarity of action out of duty as opposed to one out of self-interest,\nand so classical liberal theory is wanting. Its error rested, indeed, on an optimist\nassessment of the outcome of the broad application of rationality: optimist\nassessments prevent the appearance of the difference in attitude that morality\nprescribes between satisfying the personal interests and those of others . World War II\nexposed this optimism as an error. It matters not whether the error was in the\nassessment of the ease with which rationality would be broadly applicable or in the\nassessment of its outcome. What matters is that the optimist assessment of the\noutcome of our actions is no longer the default option, and that it should stay\nnonetheless as an assumption for our actions \u2013 as a stable working hypothesis.\nA dreadful example for this is the conduct of the Jewish leadership, especially\nthe Zionist leadership in the United States of America during the Holocaust. They\nsabotaged efforts to rescue the Jews of Europe [Agassi, 1999, Ch. 15]. Now they say,\nthey knew these efforts were hopeless. This is a mere excuse, not only because\nrecords available now refute this assessment, but also and more so because a priori\nsuch assessments may be false. Still, admittedly, at the time the assessment was bleak\nand it was reasonable (though erroneous). This example may be poor. This is of little\nconsequence, since alternative examples are easily available.\nThe hypothesis that we may make a difference should serve as a hyper-stable\nworking hypothesis. It is my alternative to the ideas of Popper and of Bartley about\nthe choice of a theory of rationality. Let me explain.\n2. Between Classical Rationalism and Fideism\nThe starting point here, to repeat, is the admission of the skeptical criticism of the\nclassical theory of rationality: proof is impossible. Advocates of irrationalis m often\nuse this criticism as the rationale for their rejection of all theories of rationality and\nof all proposal and demand to behave rationally. Those who reject the classical\ntheory but wish to adopt another add some adjective to the name of the theory of\nrationality to differentiate it from a theory that they might endorse. The adjectives\noften used are &#34;traditional&#34;, &#34;classical&#34; and &#34;Cartesian&#34;; Karl Popper suggested\n&#34;comprehensive&#34;, since the classical version advocates the comprehensive demand to\naffirm no view ever except proven ones.\nBeing comprehensive, classical rationalism demands to jettison all of familiar\nideas, so that the learning venture should begin afresh with no assumptions, with a\nclean slate, and with utterly open minds. In brief, classical rationalism is radical.\nDescartes attempted to apply it in his celebrated thought experiment, performed in\nthe hope that starting afresh guarantees the establishment of a true, scientific image\nof the world. He failed, as did all of his disciples.\nThe classical theory of rationality bumps into two interlocking standard\nobjections. The first is the classical skeptical argument: proof is question-begging.\nAn obvious logical way to overcome this is by the admission of some sufficiently\nstrong initial basic axiom. The standard examples are, the principle of the simplicity\nof nature, or of limited variety, or of induction. Some other axioms are available as\nwell. Their adherents defend their choices with a new argument that exposes the\ncomprehensiveness of classical rationalism as further weakness: the principle,\nwhatever it is, requires the assumption that it suffices for the development of a\nrational worldview and of science as we know it. This added assumption repeatedly\nmeets with a refutation that exposes the proposed principle as not good enough.\nConsider then the opposite extreme: irrationalism. Its advocates recommend\ngiving up rationality; this fascinates those who find the irrational attractive, appealing,\noverpowering: they are tired of rationality. They are intentionally unreasonable,\nforgetting that the intellect is the most powerful instrument that Nature has put at the\ndisposal of humanity, and the refusal to use it is lamentable. The advantage of\nunreason, however, is that it is license for the use of poor arguments. Those who use\nthis license denounce logic as perverse, as opposed to human natural healthy instincts,\nor to tradition or to traditional religion, or to whatever else they may advance as\nsuperior to reason. Yet, as a mere working hypothesis, this reveals some interesting\nideas. Prominent among these is the view of the first irrationalist, Heraclitus, the\nfamous pre-Socratic thinker, who probably reacted to the first version of rationalism,\nthat of Parmenides. Plato's Socrates called irrationalists mysologists, the haters of\nlogic (Phaido). Despite this hatred Heraclitus offered some valuable criticism of\nrationalism and some new ideas. Nevertheless, here let us dismiss misology.\nIrrationalists need not giving up the use of the intellect. Its use does not require\nany recognition of it as an authority over all thought processes \u2013 it can be useful\nwithout being authoritative in any way. Hence, irrationalists may have a choice in\nspecifying what portion of their thought process the intellect is not to control, as long\nas the choice does not intervene with their ability to use logic, even with a vengeance,\nin areas deemed well within the province of reason, such as mathematics and physics\nand their practical applications. What then is the suggestion to limit rationality?\nWhere exactly does rationality cease to adjudicate? The irrationalist literature has\nmany answers to this question that serve well as merely working hypotheses.\nThe better of the disenchanted with classical rationalism distinguish between\nthe criticism of the classical theory of rationality that all of them endorse and the idea\non which they disagree as to what to place outside the domain of the intellect. They\nrightly insist that the latter is less important than the former, since it leads them to\nagree that some presupposition, no matter what, must obtain with no rational basis,\nno matter upon what other kind of basis it might rest; indeed, they may add, one may\nendorse quite arbitrarily any presupposition as the initial basic axiom for rationality.\nSome presuppositions are so useless that they are overlooked. (For example, the\nassertion that Superman exists will be obviously utterly useless here.) They\nadvocated arbitrary presuppositions are usually far from being satisfactory too, but as\nworking hypotheses they may be handy and when one fails its advocate may abandon\nit for another. Of course, being irrationalists they may also cling to it dogmatically.\nAn example of this dogmatism is collectivism, made popular by \xc9mile\nDurkheim, one of the two acknowledged fathers of modern sociology. Most\nirrationalists endorse collectivism dogmatically, despite its obvious defects; they take\nas their initial basic axiom tradition, religious or national, or some authority,\nintellectual or political, or any other item that they declare vital for the maintenance\nof social stability. Their basic axiom then is that society with no stability is too\nobjectionable to take seriously into consideration as a viable option. This is sad, but\nthere are sad options on the opposite side too, namely on the side of individualism.\nAs a stable working hypothesis this is very common in the social sciences. It is\nespecially popular as Max Weber, the other of the two acknowledged fathers of\nmodern sociology. He took as the initial basic axiom for rationality a personal faith.\nThis is the source of the label \u201cfideism\u201d (&#34;fideo&#34; means, I believe). Advocates of\nfideism stress the logical impossibility of rationalism as long as it is comprehensive,\nand the need to choose an initial basic axiom in order to reinstate it. Assuming\nnothing, one has no reason to activate the project of developing rationalism and a\nrational worldview. This is the so-called &#34;the tu-quoque argument&#34; (meaning, you\ntoo): comprehensive rationalism is impossible, therefore, rationalism too rests on an\ninitial basic axiom, namely, that rationality is at all possible and desirable.\nRather than ask, what did Weber use for proof, let us examine the tu-quoque\nargument. Supposing that it is valid; does this support fideism? Does it exonerate the\nutter arbitrariness (absence of logic) of the choice of an initial basic axiom? It does\nnot sound right. Most advocates of fideism believe in their tradition and Weber hated\ntradition and expressed faith in science. This observation is so obvious that we must\nascribe its neglect to its being taken for granted: of course, the initial basic axiom has\nto be sufficiently rich in content to enable it to save rationalism from its initial\npredicament. That we take this constraint for granted is obvious, yet the systematic\nneglect of its articulation is a remiss, since there is an obvious need to specify its\nfeatures and discuss them. Now, how should we decide whether our chosen initial\nbasic axiom is strong enough? Should it perhaps also be not too strong? And then,\neven if we find that our chosen axiom is strong enough but not too strong, then we\nmay ask, is it unique? If it is, then we can eschew fideism even in the light of the tu-\nquoque argument \u2013 as unnecessary: the constraint to classical rationalism imposed on\nit by the tu-quoque argument then leaves no room for any arbitrariness and it then\nbecomes eminently rational as the most efficient means to rescue rationality.\nThis move is very welcome, as it dispenses with the most undesirable corollary\nto fideism, namely, the claim that there are different and equally legitimate kinds of\nrationalism, depending on one's pre-logical choice of one's initial basic axiom, and\nthat the validity of each is constrained by its alternatives. What is said here may be\ntrue or false, but it is a way out of the predicament of classical rationalism that is not\nfideist in the usual sense of the word, as it employs the tu-quoque argument without\nconceding the arbitrary choice of any axiom.\nThe undesirable corollary just mentioned was praised by the great fideist and\nmystic anthropologist Sir Edward Evans-Pritchard as most desirable. This makes his\nfideism not so arbitrary. Any defense of the choice of an initial basic axiom will then\nbe rational. And then it is better to take as the initial basic axiom Russell's celebrated\nproposal.  Another proposal, perhaps even better, was introduced by Popper in\nChapter 24 of his classic The Open Society and Its Enemies of 1945: the belief that\ncriticism bespeaks progress. He called this &#34;the faith in reason&#34; and characterized it\nas the minimal required deviation from comprehensive rationalism. Russell hoped\nthat his a priori supposition would permit reinstatement of classical rationalism in\nsome attenuation; Popper offered a fully-fledged new theory of rationality as\ndisproof. If any suggestion for an initial basic axiom is acceptable, then a theory of\nrationality is possible such that it is neither classical nor fideist, and this regardless of\nwhether the proof or disproof is taken to be the criterion of rationality. The claim is\nthat the arbitrariness of the initial choice does not follow from the tu-quoque\nargument, so that it can be made quite rationally.\nIf classical rationalism is to be fully restored, however, it is not enough to\nqualify it rationally: proof has to be shown possible. If it is, then an example will\nestablish this possibility. Is there any? It is easy to adduce proofs, and even of diverse\nkinds, mathematical, scientific, and legal: for convictions in murder trials evidence\nshould establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and at times it is declared achieved.\nSkeptics and advocates of fideism admit that such proofs exist. The question is the\nsame as, would such proofs be acceptable to Descartes as valid? We do not quite\nknow what kind of proof would satisfy Descartes, and probably he himself did not\nknow that either. To restrict the discussion to mathematics will not do; he would not\nagree to this. Also, this would not help as controversy still surrounds the question,\nwhat are proofs in mathematics? Descartes did offer a criterion for valid proof, but it\nis unclear and by now abandoned. To be clear about what valid proof comprises, a\ntheory of proof is required. But then, naturally, whatever this theory will turn out to\nbe, it will be question-begging. It is this very observation that led to the ancient\nskeptic conclusion that proof is impossible. Hence [classical] rationality, too, is\nimpossible. So, the followers of Pyrrho, the Pyrrhonists, suggested that one should\nnever adopt any view, that one should always suspend judgment. Fideism is not any\nphilosophy that takes some initial axiom for granted: most philosophies do so.\nFideism is the endorsement of the skeptical critique of classical rationalism as\nlogically unassailable, plus the refusal to abide by the proposal to suspend all\njudgments or the observation that no one can follow this proposal. Advocates of\nfideism declare the only way out of skepticism the initial endorsement of some basic\naxiom prior to the acceptance of the rationalist canons of proof. Taking this last\nsentence seriously one may see that whether the proposals of Russell and of Popper\nare satisfactory or not, they have unquestionably rendered a great service by refuting\nthis fideist assertion: feasible or not, they show the existence of alternatives that are\nnot as arbitrary. They have thus sensitized us to the inconsistency of the advocates of\nfideism who defend their initial basic axioms, and even without stating them\nexplicitly.\n2. Between Fideism and Critical Rationalism\nThe question, which axiom to endorse, seems to advocates of fideism beside the\npoint: as the choice of an initial basic axiom is arbitrary in the sense that (for logical\nreasons) it is pre-rational and so not rational. Here some doubt as to the sincerity of\ncontrary notwithstanding.\nadvocates of fideism may be raised: how come they usually endorse the faith of their\nfathers, whatever this happens to be? They retort that this choice is the most\nconvenient. This sounds as if convenience is the supreme criterion of choice.\nMoreover, which choice is more convenient invites the investigations that they\nforego. One may try for comfort different initial basic axioms one after the other:\ntake as an initial axiom the thesis that repetition renders choice progressively\nintelligent and reasonable. This kind of conduct, and the decision to adopt it, is\nrational. The best variant of fideism, then, the one closest to the fideist own mode of\nreasoning, is to make a basic decision afresh each day. Advocates of fideism may\nreject this as it is inconvenient, but then, criteria for convenience as well as feels for\nit are no initial axioms and so they can be overruled. To conclude, even if fideism is\ntrue and an arbitrary choice of some initial axiom is required, it need not be final.\nSome existentialist philosophers say that a commitment to an initial axiom that is not\nlife-long is not serious. But to take seriousness as more compelling than intellectual\nprogress makes it one's initial basic axiom, and an inadmissible one at that, since it\nruns contrary to logic by blocking all criticism. Admitting this, however, demands\nthat every candidate for initial basic axiom should prove irrefutable.\nAdvocates of fideism ignore the range of choice of initial axioms to employ as\nthe basis of rational thought, possibly because most of them are traditionalists and\nonce they succeed to reconcile their traditional faith with rationalism they are content.\nIf so, then this is their initial basic axiom: they are traditionalists and rationalists. Is\ntheir choice arbitrary? Some of them endorse their traditions without examination;\nothers defend them in the name of social stability, and of these, Evans -Pritchard and\nothers, conclude that different traditions hold for different societies. They defend\nrationalism while rejecting the classical Cartesian hostility to tradition.\nAll this is conjecture, which is thus suspect, especially since finding any\nrationale to the fideist initial basic axiom deprives it of its arbitrariness and so of its\nvery fideism. But then, whenever advocates of fideism argue for their fusion of\ntradition and reason, they do so by defending their initial basic axiom \u2500 as arbitrary\nor otherwise \u2500 they are advocates of fideism no longer.\nMost non-religious advocates of fideism are pragmatists; they advocate faith in\nscience for practical reasons. This invites a careful distinction between pragmatists\nproper and pragmatist advocates of fideism: the former view usefulness as the basic\ncriterion for belief in any opinion; they deem utility the ground of belief: according\nto them rationality is not proof but usefulness. Hence, like Popper, they offer a non-\nclassical, theory of rationality and so they are not advocates of fideism at all. Hence,\nthe best criticism of pragmatism proper is the observation that in order to decide what\nidea is useful we need some workable criterion of rational decision between the\noptions that the choice of this or that hypothesis is most useful. Advocates of fideism\ndo not claim that utility or any other criterion is a criterion of rationality; rather, they\ntake it as the initial basic axiom that is chosen prior to being rational, as the\nprecondition for it; other than that, they adhere to the classical view of rationality as\nproof, and so the strong criticism of pragmatism just voiced does not apply to their\nview. One may, of course, suggest that the initial choice of rationality is not useful,\nbut this is an initial basic axiom, a dogma not subject to critical debate.\nToday taking science to be the most useful set of beliefs to advocate is\nextremely popular. Its popularity suggests that possibly behind it stands mental\nlaziness plus the hypothesis that following the majority is most convenient. This is no\nfideism. Nor is the thoughtless adherence to the majority view, nor is the view of one\nwho has never examined one\u2019s views and who does not know what exactly it is. It\nmay but need not be fideist proper. It is clear that these differ; the question is, does\nthis difference make a practical difference? A difference, to be a [real] difference,\nsaid arch-pragmatist William James, must make a [practical] difference. Is there a\npractical difference between pragmatism proper and pragmatist fideism?\nAt least this should be observed: the tu-quoque argument makes it clear that\nthose who use it view us all as advocates of fideism at heart, whether we know it or\nnot; and then even if everyone behave in the fideist manner, the advocates of fideism\nare still practically better off as they possess a greater self-awareness. But surely,\nwhether this is so or not is both forever question-begging and empirically decidable,\nwhich is absurd.\nPragmatists have replaced proof with utility as the criterion of rationality.\nOther criteria may be proof-substitutes too. Each of them may serve as an alternative\nto the classical theory of rationality or as a fideist basis for the quasi-classical one.\nThis depicts the whole scheme in a new way. For, now the question is generalized:\npragmatists or others who take utility or any other quality as their supreme criterion,\ndo they use it repeatedly and eschew proof proper, or do they use it initially and then\nrequire proof? Is theirs an alternative rationalist view or is it a quasi-rationalist one?\nThis is a big difference, as it is procedural and so it effects almost every deliberation:\ndeliberations may employ proof (though on the basis of an arbitrarily chosen axiom)\nand they may employ an altogether different criterion of rationality.\nThis reasoning may expose pragmatism as a version of fideism; it also exposes\nadvocates of fideism as rationalists for all intents and purpose, as long their initial\nbasic choice of rationalism is not challenged. Their discussions can, perhaps also\nshould, be scrutinized as to whether or not, in addition to their axioms, advocates of\nfideism usually advocate the demand for proof. Now, clearly, almost all discussions\nincorporate some initial hypotheses, except for Descartes' radical thought experiment\nand its alternatives, all of which are now judged unavoidably failures. Hence, there is\nno practical difference between the fideist mode of arguing and other, except for one:\nwhenever what they happen to consider their initial basic axioms happens to be\nchallenged, they refuse to discuss it. Here, all of a sudden, the tu-quoque argument\nbreaks down and drops out of the picture. Contrary to it, there is a basic difference\nbetween the fideist and others: we all exempt some dogma from the demand to\nexamine it rationally, but the advocates of fideism exempt their own dogma\nconsciously and systematically and for good. This is a great self-awareness, and one\nthat they might naturally take pride of. It turns out to be their awareness of their\nirrevocable commitment to a dogma, and as a necessity. But this turns out to be a\nmistake: there are better ways to handle the situation.\nThe very use of the tu-quoque argument rests on error: it is used as an excuse\nto exempt from rational scrutiny some unspecified view, on the basis of the\nobservation that usually we all do so (since the skeptic critique of classical\nrationalism is valid). But we all do so now and then, whereas advocates of fideism do\nso come-what-may. This is why the suggestion to keep one's initial axiom floating is\nso deadly to fideism; its hidden assumption is that their retreat to commitment is a\nleap of faith in the sense of Kierkegaard, as Bartley has discovered.\nBartley saw the situation this way: taking the tu-quoque argument as support\nfor fideism is placing it on the borderline between rationalism and irrationalism and\ninvites efforts to refute it: its refutation is required not for irrationalists but for\nrationalists. He was in error: the tu-quoque argument is but a variant on the skeptic\ncritique. Even were it unanswerable, it would remain better to take reason upon faith\nthan to be defensive about some proper dogma. This point belongs to Popper. It is\nlovely. In his effort to dodge Bartley\u2019s criticism he lost it. pity.\nThis is no defense of classical rationalism, of course, since the skeptic critique\nof it as question-begging is taken here as valid, even if only as a working hypothesis;\nthis is to dismiss the fideist critique as no boost for it. This dismissal holds equally\nfor classical rationalism and to any other variant. To make this evident, let us\nconsider the idea of the ancient Pyrrhonist school, the view that one can live w ithout\nadherence to any view, with total and permanent suspension of judgment, and that\nthe practice of the suspension of judgment provides peace of mind (ataraxia). This is\nquestionable, but let this ride and let us ask, is Pyrrhonism fideist? Possibly, as a\nmatter of fact, every school has an initial basic axiom. Even were this true, as neither\nschool has noted this, it is hard to decide which of the two schools is nearer to\nfideism, the Pyrrhonists or the classical rationalists. That there is a great practical\ndifference between them, however, is all too clear. Hence, the tu-quoque argument\nmakes no practical difference even between skeptics and classical rationalists, though\nthe skeptical argument clearly does.\nI know Popper and Bartle agreed that they d isagreed; I do not know on what.\nPerhaps Popper has offered a new comprehensive theory of rationality that is less\nquestion-begging than comprehensive classical rationalism, perhaps not; Bartley\nclaimed that he did and that Popper did not; but then perhaps both did and perhaps\nneither did. If both did, and if both did not, are the views of the two identical? For\nuncontested background information, the very demand for openness to criticism is\ntaken for granted. Popper\u2019s innovation that Bartley endorsed but that is still the\nminority view is the assertion that this demand suffices for rationality, including the\nrationality of science. Popper's theory of rationality is very far-reaching, and is far\nfrom obvious. Bartley found it admirable but defective in not being comprehensive.\n3. Between Popper and Bartley\nscience Adolf Gr\xfcnbaum who calls himself neo-Baconian and denies Popper his originality.\nWhereas classical rationalism broke down because it is comprehensive, fideism is\npainful because it is not. Hence, rejecting both amounts to rejectingwhat they share:\nthe idea that rationality is proof. Consider, then, critical rationalism, the idea that\nrationality is disproof. Can we not show both options of it, qualified and\ncomprehensive, likewise painful? Can we apply the skeptical argument to\ncomprehensive critical rationalism and find it wanting, and then to apply the\nrationalist critique of fideism to qualified critical rationalism, and then be done with\nit altogether? Let me defeat this program.\nConsider first the application of classical rationalism to critical rationalism\n(qualified or comprehensive). This way critical rationalism fails of course. This has\nbeen showed repeatedly in the literature, yet it is trivial. Moreover, this is offered as\nfatal criticism, yet it is no criticism at all: there is no reason why critical rationalism\nshould submit to the rules of classical rationalism. Should it be applied to itself\ninstead? That classical rationalism should be proven by its own light is clear. But\ncritical rationalism should be held open to criticism, perhaps, or else it should be\nqualified. Here possibly Popper and Bartley disagreed. What is the reasoning here?\nCan we discuss this matter without begging the question?\nThe claim that logic is obligatory is inherent in the history of the debate over\nrationality. Hence, it is not contested that the aim of criticism is to refute its object.\nFrom the very start Popper stressed that he never adjudicated the matter of the\nsuccess of each piece of criticism, that all he said in general was no more than what\nlogic requires: if and when a piece of criticism is judged successful, then it is thereby\nalso judged as having refuted its object. To repeat, Popper offers as a solution to the\nproblem of rationality not a logical truth, but a conjecture, the novel theory that\ndisproof suffices for the advancement of knowledge in general and of science in\nparticular. How does he know that disproof suffices? He does not; it is his conjecture.\nQuery: is it rational to advocate this presupposition, this initial basic axiom? Can\nthere be a critical debate of it? If not, it seems fideist; if yes, it seems comprehensive.\nWhich is it?\nAssume that we must choose some initial basic axiom; how can the choice be\nrational? Given Popper's theory of rationality as openness to criticism, the answer to\nthis question is obvious: to the extent that it is criticizable and open to criticism, it is.\nDoes this apply to Popper's own choice? Should a critical rationalist be open-minded\nabout being open-minded? This is hard to say. Let us try to do so by splitting critical\nrationalism into two theses, one minor, one major, so that the question splits into two\nas well. The minor thesis is that criticism is binding. Is it? In other words, is logic\nbinding? The major thesis is that disproof suffices for intellectual progress. Is it? Till\nnow adherence to logic was taken for granted; nevertheless, possibly, comprehensive\ncritical rationalism requires an examination of our commitment to logic.\nAlready Plato asked, how binding is logic? In the end of his Phaedo,\ndescribing Socrates' last minutes, he ascribes to him the refusal to give up reason;\nnothing, Socrates seems to say, will sway him away from logic: he will never be a\nmysologist: even in his last hour he will gladly accept criticism. It is hard to say\nwhether this reading of the text is right, since the question is intricate. But Popper's\ntext seemed to me clear enough \u2500 until he declared Bartley's reading of it erroneous:\nI then began to doubt my reading of his text. For a lark, however, let me cling to my\nold reading of his text, as examining a view is more important than its authorship.\n(Besides, the first author of qualified critical rationalism is anyway Plato or Heinrich\nHeine.) To avoid all misconception of my motive, let me repeat: this discussion is no\ndefense of Popper or of Bartley, since I dissent from both.\nPlato's insistence on open-mindedness, his refusal to be open-minded about it,\nseems to identify rationality with logic. This is not clear, especially since formal\nlogic was invented later, and since it was not satisfactory till the twentieth century, if\never. So logic was open to criticism. Is it still? If yes, can its authority be revoked? In\nother words, can there be a critical debate on the rationality of logic, and if it is found\ndefective, can it be taken for granted? This depends on what we mean by the demand\nto reject a refuted version of it. If it is the demand to improve logic, then yes; if it is\nthe demand to jettison it, then no. Hence, in the broad sense logic is not given to\nrational deliberations, and so it is the initial axiom of rationality. Yet, in the narrow\nsense logic is very much given to rational deliberations, and this is expressed in the\nperennial efforts to improve it. (This seems to be the major thrust of the critique of\nthe view of logic as above criticism that we usually ascribe to Van Quine.)\nThis holds for all possible versions of the theory of rationality, since, to repeat,\ndiscussion of it was always conducted within logic. And then, Popper's claim that\nrationality is not comprehensive can be seen (not as a concession to fideism but) as\nmaking explicit a point that was traditionally taken for granted and that the modern\nhistory of logic makes its explicit statement desirable: the broad commitment to logic\ninvites efforts at its improvement in detail. Once this is noted, the discussion of\ncomprehensiveness has to be recast in a more precise manner. For example, the\nadvocates of fideism' commitment to their tradition is less irrational if it is only a\nbroad commitment, while being open-minded about any detail of it. (This is no small\ndifference, as it replaces the refusal to engage in intellectual traffic between different\ntraditions with a proposal to have it, at least up to a point, but the point is movable.)\nPopper has advocated this attitude to tradition in his classic if neglected 1947\n&#34;Towards a Rational Theory of Tradition&#34; [Popper, 1963].\nWith more due care, then, Bartley's comprehensiveness may read, his\ncommitment to logic is rational since he is open to its critical assessment. The same\nholds for Popper, of course. Where, then, is the difference between qualified and\ncomprehensive critical rationalism? Perhaps the difference lies in the disagreement\nabout the major thesis, the thesis that the engagement in critical debates suffices for\nthe advancement of learning. Since criticism involves logic, the discussion of the\nmajor thesis involves the minor one, but we need not go over this ground again.\nSuppose that the thesis that criticism suffices for progress is refuted, then. What will\nthis suggest to critical rationalists? Again, it seems, it will invite an improvement, not\na total overthrow. This seems to be the attitude advocated and practiced by both\nattitudes. So how do they differ?\nThis is not an idle thought. Critical rationalism was criticized both ways: once\n\u2500 by Feyerabend and myself \u2500 with the observation that at times the suspension of\ncriticism (at least for a lark) is wise (as Popper admitted citing Galileo to that effect)\nand once \u2500 by myself \u2500 with the observation that scholasticism was critical but not\nprogressive. The reason for this defect is clear: scholastic criticism was conducted\nwithin a given framework that was not given to criticism; this was done consciously,\non the ground of the view that debates have to be limited by some initial basic axio m,\nvery much in the fideist manner. Popper was aware of this: in his early work he\ndemanded that the most theory most given to criticism should be examined first, and\nhe later criticized the scholastic theory, which he called &#34;the myth of the framework&#34;.\nHe was thus unclear if not inconsistent. The way to overcome the inconsistency is to\nspeak of maximal criticism instead of criticism when wording the thesis of critical\nrationalism. Popper suggested that the demand for maximal openness to criticism\nwill eliminate, or at least sufficiently prevent, the use of ad hoc hypotheses, as there\nreduce the level of openness to criticism of hypotheses.\nExcept that this was criticized too \u2500 also by myself. Many theories in\ntechnology are very open to criticism yet are very much ad hoc; efforts to put them to\ntest are made repeatedly, as they are of great technological value. Yet they are not\ndeemed intellectually as interesting as the scarcely testable theories that are on the\nforefront of theoretical research. Since critical rationalism does not differentiate\nbetween pure and applied research, it demands improvement. This holds for Popper\nand for Bartley equally.\nSince qualified critical rationalism demands openness to criticism not only in\nthe abstract but also as exhibited in the possibility of a concrete criticism, in the high\nrisk of the theory in question, Bartley could ask Popper, how great should this risk be\nbefore it is deemed great enough? Popper had an answer to this question already in\n1935, but only as far as science is concerned: the risk is measured there by the\nlikelihood of an experiment that can be designed and performed to refute the theory\nin question; this likelihood can be measured by some extant alternative or by\ncommon sense. But Popper himself admitted in 1945 that weaker kinds of criticism\nare possible, in history and in philosophy, including ethics. How much should the\nrisk be a real one? (Significantly, Bartley took seriously the weak criticism that\npseudo-intellectual sects directed against the established commonwealth of learning.\nHe suggested [Bartley, 1990, 100] that since the academy is so very dogmatic, these\nfleeting intellectual clusters are where the action really is. This view is intriguing but\nalas not serious.) Nor is that all. Popper spent much of his effort arguing that\ncriticism is beneficial, which should be incontestable, and that the theory of\nrationality as the critical attitude does not suffer from the skeptical critique. Bartley\non his part spent much time arguing that since critical rationalism is not hit by the\nskeptic critique it can be held comprehensively. But they both argued prematurely,\noverlooking the critical examination of the claim that they perform the task for which\nthey were designed.\nThe question that the classical theory of rationality came to answer is, what\ntheory should be believed? Critical rationalists refuse to answer this question, as it\nprefers the diversity of opinions. Rather, it comes to exclude the theories that are not\nreasonable to believe, beginning with traditional local myths. The wish to promote\nthe progress of science is better than the wish to believe in current science. Proof\ndoes not do it; does disproof? No; critical rationalism never guaranteed success. Can\nit at least explain success? No; explanation amounts to guarantee: to say that A is\ncaused by B is to guarantee the presence of A in the presence of B. Critical\nrationalism guarantees not the success in providing conjectures and their criticism,\nbut that when these are present, progress obtains. How? The answer is what makes\ncritical rationalism so very intriguing: criticism is not the cause of intellectual\nprogress; it is intellectual progress. This, however, is a new conception of progress,\nand it can be challenged. We have not shed light this way on an important matter:\nwhy is the Popper-Bartley dispute important? In answer to this Bartley said,\nerroneously, because the tu-quoque argument is a serious challenge. This challenge\nmay signify at most for critical rationalism, not for science proper.\n4. Rationality as Partial and as Social\nWe see again that the discussion requires better presentation. Let us begin with\nrationality, whatever it is. Rationality as proof is an all-or-nothing affair; criticism is\npossibly more graded. Consider it a matter of degree. I. C. Jarvie and I have\nintroduced this idea decades ago. The measure of the degree of rationality, we\nsuggest, is not some abstract scale but depends on the available intellectual tools. It is\nclear, we said, that for one living in a preliterate society the most rational act and\nattitude will be much inferior to that available to one living in a society familiar with\nscience. This enters the social dimens ion into the debate, and so it really needs going\nover and, when necessary, recast. This is no small matter. Traditionally the options\navailable to social philosophy were individualism and collectivism. As collectivism\nnaturally distrusts individual reason as disruptive, it tends to be irrationalist.\nIndividualism then ruled the debate on rationality. And as individuals depend on\nsociety to this or that extent, though not wholly, their rationality should be cast in\nsocial terms and then viewed as partial.\nTo take a simple example, whereas traditional advocates of fideism discussed\nthe matter of rationality in an individualist framework, they could hardly answer the\nquestion, how should I choose my initial axioms? They did not have clear instances\nof initial axioms, and it looked as if infinitely many alternatives are available. Asking\nthe question in a social manner it becomes the question of the choice of a community,\nand there are a few communities to join; moreover, one cannot change communities\nevery week, and so, for merely technical reasons, one must live on one so as to\nacquire is basic tenets. It was stressed by Michael Polanyi, that when one joins a\ncommunity one scarcely knows what it has to offer, especially if the community in\nquestion is the scientific community, and that when one learns the initial basic\naxioms one may find that they are not given to simple articulation. He stressed,\nhowever, that one can belong to more than one community without fear of\ncontradiction. He did not elaborate. Another historical example should serve as\nevidence of the defect of the abstract discussion that Popper still participated in: the\nold scholastic tradition is not considered as rational as the new scientific tradition\n(even on the supposition that the old gave birth to the young). I skip the details here.\nAs long as science plays the role of a paradigm of rational activity, the\nindividual is most rational when joining the scientific community. Popper has\nsuggested that science is a social institution, one that encourages criticism. He also\nsuggested that parliamentary democracy is such a paradigm, and the same holds for\nthat paradigm. That there may be inconsistency between science and democracy, as\nwell as within each, is no reason for defection, as it may be a challenge for efforts to\nimprove. Popper said, the reason for these being paradigms of rationality is that\nrationality is the effort to improve through criticism.\nCan we rephrase the Popper-Bartley dispute within a social framework? All\ntheories of rationality recommend joining actively the life of science and of\ndemocracy. The view of rationality as improvable goes better with critical\nrationalism than with classical rationalism. Is here a significant difference between\nPopper and Bartley? Can we rephrase Bartley's philosophy socially? I do not know.\nThe critical attitude commends both a personal openness to criticism and an\ninstitutional setup that encourages criticism and is open to reform. The criticism of an\ninstitution, or of an institutionalized opinion, however, is not the same as the\ncriticism of an individual's opinion: the one is a personal matter, the other is social.\nValid criticism should always lead one to the search of alternatives, and reform is\naccepted not after criticism is voiced and endorsed but after a viable alternative is\nfound and tested in instituted manners. What this means for Popper is clear enough:\nboth democracy and science are open to reform. What does this mean for Bartley\nabove and beyond what it means to Popper I cannot see. Perhaps this means that\npossibly democracy and/or science will be criticized in a new manner that will lead\nto a proposal of a totally new regime and/or research protocol and Bartley will be\nwilling to test it. Whether this is so or not is hard to say: the discussion becomes too\nabstract here.\nBibliography\nAgassi, Joseph, 1981.

 u"Giuseppe Franco, editor, Der Kritische Rationalismus als Denkmethode und\nLebensweise: Festscrhift zum 90. Geburtstag von Hans Albert. Klagenfurt: Kitab,\n2012, 34-55\nCritical Rationalism, Comprehensive or Qualified:\nThe Popper-Bartley Dispute\nBy Joseph Agassi,\nTel-Aviv University and York University, Toronto\n0. Background.\nKarl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945,\nCh. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason.\nLater on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and\neven called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to\nhis annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave,\n1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter\nis very complicated. Let me show this now.\nFideism is a minimal retreat from classical rationalism. As this theory is\ncomprehensive in its demand for proof as ultimate justification, it begs the question\nof its own justification. All parties to the current dispute admit that this is a defect\nthat has no cure except by some modification. To that end adherents to fideism\nadvocate some axiom taken on faith as the minimum necessary concession to\nirrationalism. The rationalism that the advocates of fideism qualify is the classical\ntheory of rationality, that is, to be precise, an assertion plus a demand. The theory is,\nrationality equals proof. The demand is to make an assertion \u2013 or to endorse it, to\nbelieve it \u2013 if and only if proof is available that the assertion is true. As the skeptics\nhave shown, any proof of any (synthetic) assertion requires a proof theory that\nrequires proof in its turn. (The possibly of proof in logic and in mathematics has no\nplace in the present discussion.) The skeptics have then recommended holding no\nbelief, making no definite assertion, holding all views only tentatively. Skeptics\nclaim that they have a proof that no proof is possible that should satisfy classical\nrationalists. Most rationalists have invested much effort in attempts to find fault in\nthat proof, and they are still trying. As this essay concerns the dispute between\nPopper and Bartley, who both endorse the skeptic proof, we may take the skeptical\nproof for granted. Hence, the classical theory of rationality cannot stay as it is. The\nadvocates of fideism conclude, then, that some retreat is imperative. The minimal\ndeviation is an assertion that advocates of fideism recommend to endorse without\nproof. That is to say, they recommend its endorsement upon faith. There are two\nstandard candidates for that assertion: the principle of induction and the faith of one\u2019s\nforefathers.\nOf course, not all deviation from the classical theory of rationality is fideist.\nSince advocates of fideism propose that the deviation from the old view should be\nminimal, it is hard to see how this proposal is contestable. An obvious point to\ncontest concerns the question, what deviation is minimal. On this Popper has made a\nbrilliant alternative proposal. Although it has not gained popularity among advocates\nof fideism, it is obviously the best thus far offered. It is this. The least concession\nshould not be the faith in any principle of induction, much less in a given traditional\nfaith, but preferably in the possibility that rational debate may generate progress.\nAdvocates of fideism may object to this obviously superior proposal: it accompanies\na lower standard of rationality. Whereas the classical theory of rationality equates\nrationality with proof, Popper\u2019s theory equates rationality with the critical attitude.\nWhat is preferable, one irrational axiom or this reduction of the standard? The\nanswer is that the reduction of the standard is necessary anyway since the skeptical\ncriticism of traditional rationalism is valid. (Thus, Bertrand Russell advocated the\nadoption of some principle of induction upon faith in the hope that it will suffice to\njustify current science [Russell, 1992, 38]; [Russell, 1996, 313-28]. He did not\nmanage to formulate it explicitly.)\nPopper has proposed two brilliant minimizing moves: of the standard of\nrationality and of the concession to irrationalism. Bartley has shown that there is no\nneed for the two moves, as one will do. This he proved conclusively: reducing the\nstandard of rationality renders a concession unnecessary. It is a shame that Popper\nhas not admitted this, suggesting instead that Bartley just improved the wording of\nwhat he had intended to advocate all along: he denied that he made the mistake that\nBartley had attributed to him. It is likewise a shame that Bartley conflated his valid\ncriticism of Popper with his own alternative to it: only the criticism, not the\nalternative to the criticized theory, is uncontestable. The errors on both sides led to an\nimpasse. In desperation, Bartley called Popper a fideist, and Popper took offence. My\naim here is to rectify these two errors and thus restore the peace between their ghosts.\nNow the fideism that Bartley has saddled Popper with is at the very least not\nthe traditional version but an improvement on it. It says, welcome critical scrutiny as\nprogressive. If this is a version of fideism, then it is an admirable version of it. Both\nPopper and Bartley have confused this idea, be it a version of fideism or not, with a\nslightly greater demand: do not advocate a theory unless it has passed critical\nscrutiny. This version of rationalism, be it fideist or not, both Popper and Bartley\nrejected, and rightly so, despite its superiority over the more traditional versions of\nfideism. Regrettably they did not praise it before rejecting it, although by the canons\nof criticism they should have.\nTaking for granted here the skeptical criticism of traditional rationalism, let us\nconsider the question, which modification of it is right? Considering any proposed\nmodification, why should we adopt it? To take it upon faith has all the defects of\nfideism without its advantage (of being a minimal concession). For the sake of the\nargument, let us agree to prefer the modification that is the smallest concession to\nirrationalism. What is it? And is that preferable to the original fideist view? And\nworse, how are we to adjudicate on this without begging the question? Still worse,\nwhatever answer to this question that we may offer, will it not remain fideist at heart?\nBartley acutely observed that when Popper said that his proposal (to takes the\nfaith in reason on faith) is a deviation from rationalism, he was in error (or at the very\nleast unclear): the deviation is from classical, not from critical rationalism: applied to\nitself, classical rationalism does not live by its own precepts (it begs the question);\napplied to itself, critical rationalism may live by its own precepts, at least possibly so.\nSo far this criticism of Bartley is obviously right, and Popper should have\nacknowledged its validity. Unfortunately this did not happen. Partly it was Popper\u2019s\nfailing, partly it was a confusion that rested on the fact that Bartley had his own view\nof critical rationalism that Popper had all the right to reject \u2013 but not before admitting\nthe validity of Bartley\u2019s criticism.\nFor my own part, I am no party to this dispute [Agassi, 1981, 72, 100, 465-71,\n474, 476]. My aim here is not to take sides but to clarify it and perhaps to remove the\nvery ground for it. I reject the framework within which it takes place. My alternative\nto that framework is the idea that rationalism is a working hypothesis. Thus it is\nneither a basis for rational thought nor an object of faith, but simply an assumption\nthat facilitate rational deliberations. It seems to me that on second thought both\nPopper and Bartley would have agreed. They could object that I have not said what\nrational deliberation is, but here I defer to their own views on it, which are quite\ntraditional and also sufficiently unproblematic to serve as the default option.\nMy effort to neutralize a dispute may sound like an exercise in the tradition of\nlogical positivism. It is not. For, it replaces a metaphysical framework with a better\none, and it does not destroy a problem but replaces it with a better alternative, much\nin the tradition of critical rationalism. Thus, needless to say, I ascribe my alternative\nto Popper and Bartley and take their input as either propaedeutic (preparatory) or the\nlong way around, as you like it.\n1. The hyper-stable working hypothesis\nWhat characterizes a working hypothesis most is its fluidity: there is no commitment\nand hardly any reason to it: its adoption is for a lark. One may even take it on a whim,\nthough on occasion it is common sense. And what one takes on a whim is ephemeral,\nof course. Still, some working hypotheses stay, for good reasons or bad. My concern\nis with a working hypothesis that is hyper-stable. So let me show first that these exist.\nMy claim is that this stability is the most general characteristic of any reasonable\nview of duty. So please be patient.\nWe act voluntarily yet under constraints. Classical liberal thinkers often said,\nin principle there is no difference between free and coerced action. Nevertheless, one\ndifference matters, between keenness and reluctance: we may act reluctantly out of a\nsense of duty. Of course, classical liberal thinkers viewed duty-bound conduct as not\npeculiar, as it is up to us to decide to behave morally, so that we always act\nvoluntarily. Nevertheless, the difference between the fulfillment of one\u2019s own\ninterest and that of others is a matter of principle. This is particularly so in cases of\nacts with unlikely consequences. When we face options that are not likely to yield\nfruits, we tend to adopt choices that are easiest: the game is not worth the candle, we\nmay say to ourselves and quit. Yet when the game is obligatory, this is unacceptable.\nMany moral acts are unlikely to have worthy consequences, yet were that a sufficient\nexcuse for quitting a task allows us to be socially apathetic and even asocial. When it\ncomes to affairs of other people and more so to public affairs, as the duty of hope we\nshould grant the Good Lord the benefit of doubt [Agassi, 1999, 50-4, 124-5]. In our\nown affairs we may be more realistic. Hence, whereas optimism as an opinion is\nfoolish, as an attitude it is just right and often even obligatory.\nThis is a peculiarity of action out of duty as opposed to one out of self-interest,\nand so classical liberal theory is wanting. Its error rested, indeed, on an optimist\nassessment of the outcome of the broad application of rationality: optimist\nassessments prevent the appearance of the difference in attitude that morality\nprescribes between satisfying the personal interests and those of others . World War II\nexposed this optimism as an error. It matters not whether the error was in the\nassessment of the ease with which rationality would be broadly applicable or in the\nassessment of its outcome. What matters is that the optimist assessment of the\noutcome of our actions is no longer the default option, and that it should stay\nnonetheless as an assumption for our actions \u2013 as a stable working hypothesis.\nA dreadful example for this is the conduct of the Jewish leadership, especially\nthe Zionist leadership in the United States of America during the Holocaust. They\nsabotaged efforts to rescue the Jews of Europe [Agassi, 1999, Ch. 15]. Now they say,\nthey knew these efforts were hopeless. This is a mere excuse, not only because\nrecords available now refute this assessment, but also and more so because a priori\nsuch assessments may be false. Still, admittedly, at the time the assessment was bleak\nand it was reasonable (though erroneous). This example may be poor. This is of little\nconsequence, since alternative examples are easily available.\nThe hypothesis that we may make a difference should serve as a hyper-stable\nworking hypothesis. It is my alternative to the ideas of Popper and of Bartley about\nthe choice of a theory of rationality. Let me explain.\n2. Between Classical Rationalism and Fideism\nThe starting point here, to repeat, is the admission of the skeptical criticism of the\nclassical theory of rationality: proof is impossible. Advocates of irrationalis m often\nuse this criticism as the rationale for their rejection of all theories of rationality and\nof all proposal and demand to behave rationally. Those who reject the classical\ntheory but wish to adopt another add some adjective to the name of the theory of\nrationality to differentiate it from a theory that they might endorse. The adjectives\noften used are &#34;traditional&#34;, &#34;classical&#34; and &#34;Cartesian&#34;; Karl Popper suggested\n&#34;comprehensive&#34;, since the classical version advocates the comprehensive demand to\naffirm no view ever except proven ones.\nBeing comprehensive, classical rationalism demands to jettison all of familiar\nideas, so that the learning venture should begin afresh with no assumptions, with a\nclean slate, and with utterly open minds. In brief, classical rationalism is radical.\nDescartes attempted to apply it in his celebrated thought experiment, performed in\nthe hope that starting afresh guarantees the establishment of a true, scientific image\nof the world. He failed, as did all of his disciples.\nThe classical theory of rationality bumps into two interlocking standard\nobjections. The first is the classical skeptical argument: proof is question-begging.\nAn obvious logical way to overcome this is by the admission of some sufficiently\nstrong initial basic axiom. The standard examples are, the principle of the simplicity\nof nature, or of limited variety, or of induction. Some other axioms are available as\nwell. Their adherents defend their choices with a new argument that exposes the\ncomprehensiveness of classical rationalism as further weakness: the principle,\nwhatever it is, requires the assumption that it suffices for the development of a\nrational worldview and of science as we know it. This added assumption repeatedly\nmeets with a refutation that exposes the proposed principle as not good enough.\nConsider then the opposite extreme: irrationalism. Its advocates recommend\ngiving up rationality; this fascinates those who find the irrational attractive, appealing,\noverpowering: they are tired of rationality. They are intentionally unreasonable,\nforgetting that the intellect is the most powerful instrument that Nature has put at the\ndisposal of humanity, and the refusal to use it is lamentable. The advantage of\nunreason, however, is that it is license for the use of poor arguments. Those who use\nthis license denounce logic as perverse, as opposed to human natural healthy instincts,\nor to tradition or to traditional religion, or to whatever else they may advance as\nsuperior to reason. Yet, as a mere working hypothesis, this reveals some interesting\nideas. Prominent among these is the view of the first irrationalist, Heraclitus, the\nfamous pre-Socratic thinker, who probably reacted to the first version of rationalism,\nthat of Parmenides. Plato's Socrates called irrationalists mysologists, the haters of\nlogic (Phaido). Despite this hatred Heraclitus offered some valuable criticism of\nrationalism and some new ideas. Nevertheless, here let us dismiss misology.\nIrrationalists need not giving up the use of the intellect. Its use does not require\nany recognition of it as an authority over all thought processes \u2013 it can be useful\nwithout being authoritative in any way. Hence, irrationalists may have a choice in\nspecifying what portion of their thought process the intellect is not to control, as long\nas the choice does not intervene with their ability to use logic, even with a vengeance,\nin areas deemed well within the province of reason, such as mathematics and physics\nand their practical applications. What then is the suggestion to limit rationality?\nWhere exactly does rationality cease to adjudicate? The irrationalist literature has\nmany answers to this question that serve well as merely working hypotheses.\nThe better of the disenchanted with classical rationalism distinguish between\nthe criticism of the classical theory of rationality that all of them endorse and the idea\non which they disagree as to what to place outside the domain of the intellect. They\nrightly insist that the latter is less important than the former, since it leads them to\nagree that some presupposition, no matter what, must obtain with no rational basis,\nno matter upon what other kind of basis it might rest; indeed, they may add, one may\nendorse quite arbitrarily any presupposition as the initial basic axiom for rationality.\nSome presuppositions are so useless that they are overlooked. (For example, the\nassertion that Superman exists will be obviously utterly useless here.) They\nadvocated arbitrary presuppositions are usually far from being satisfactory too, but as\nworking hypotheses they may be handy and when one fails its advocate may abandon\nit for another. Of course, being irrationalists they may also cling to it dogmatically.\nAn example of this dogmatism is collectivism, made popular by \xc9mile\nDurkheim, one of the two acknowledged fathers of modern sociology. Most\nirrationalists endorse collectivism dogmatically, despite its obvious defects; they take\nas their initial basic axiom tradition, religious or national, or some authority,\nintellectual or political, or any other item that they declare vital for the maintenance\nof social stability. Their basic axiom then is that society with no stability is too\nobjectionable to take seriously into consideration as a viable option. This is sad, but\nthere are sad options on the opposite side too, namely on the side of individualism.\nAs a stable working hypothesis this is very common in the social sciences. It is\nespecially popular as Max Weber, the other of the two acknowledged fathers of\nmodern sociology. He took as the initial basic axiom for rationality a personal faith.\nThis is the source of the label \u201cfideism\u201d (&#34;fideo&#34; means, I believe). Advocates of\nfideism stress the logical impossibility of rationalism as long as it is comprehensive,\nand the need to choose an initial basic axiom in order to reinstate it. Assuming\nnothing, one has no reason to activate the project of developing rationalism and a\nrational worldview. This is the so-called &#34;the tu-quoque argument&#34; (meaning, you\ntoo): comprehensive rationalism is impossible, therefore, rationalism too rests on an\ninitial basic axiom, namely, that rationality is at all possible and desirable.\nRather than ask, what did Weber use for proof, let us examine the tu-quoque\nargument. Supposing that it is valid; does this support fideism? Does it exonerate the\nutter arbitrariness (absence of logic) of the choice of an initial basic axiom? It does\nnot sound right. Most advocates of fideism believe in their tradition and Weber hated\ntradition and expressed faith in science. This observation is so obvious that we must\nascribe its neglect to its being taken for granted: of course, the initial basic axiom has\nto be sufficiently rich in content to enable it to save rationalism from its initial\npredicament. That we take this constraint for granted is obvious, yet the systematic\nneglect of its articulation is a remiss, since there is an obvious need to specify its\nfeatures and discuss them. Now, how should we decide whether our chosen initial\nbasic axiom is strong enough? Should it perhaps also be not too strong? And then,\neven if we find that our chosen axiom is strong enough but not too strong, then we\nmay ask, is it unique? If it is, then we can eschew fideism even in the light of the tu-\nquoque argument \u2013 as unnecessary: the constraint to classical rationalism imposed on\nit by the tu-quoque argument then leaves no room for any arbitrariness and it then\nbecomes eminently rational as the most efficient means to rescue rationality.\nThis move is very welcome, as it dispenses with the most undesirable corollary\nto fideism, namely, the claim that there are different and equally legitimate kinds of\nrationalism, depending on one's pre-logical choice of one's initial basic axiom, and\nthat the validity of each is constrained by its alternatives. What is said here may be\ntrue or false, but it is a way out of the predicament of classical rationalism that is not\nfideist in the usual sense of the word, as it employs the tu-quoque argument without\nconceding the arbitrary choice of any axiom.\nThe undesirable corollary just mentioned was praised by the great fideist and\nmystic anthropologist Sir Edward Evans-Pritchard as most desirable. This makes his\nfideism not so arbitrary. Any defense of the choice of an initial basic axiom will then\nbe rational. And then it is better to take as the initial basic axiom Russell's celebrated\nproposal.  Another proposal, perhaps even better, was introduced by Popper in\nChapter 24 of his classic The Open Society and Its Enemies of 1945: the belief that\ncriticism bespeaks progress. He called this &#34;the faith in reason&#34; and characterized it\nas the minimal required deviation from comprehensive rationalism. Russell hoped\nthat his a priori supposition would permit reinstatement of classical rationalism in\nsome attenuation; Popper offered a fully-fledged new theory of rationality as\ndisproof. If any suggestion for an initial basic axiom is acceptable, then a theory of\nrationality is possible such that it is neither classical nor fideist, and this regardless of\nwhether the proof or disproof is taken to be the criterion of rationality. The claim is\nthat the arbitrariness of the initial choice does not follow from the tu-quoque\nargument, so that it can be made quite rationally.\nIf classical rationalism is to be fully restored, however, it is not enough to\nqualify it rationally: proof has to be shown possible. If it is, then an example will\nestablish this possibility. Is there any? It is easy to adduce proofs, and even of diverse\nkinds, mathematical, scientific, and legal: for convictions in murder trials evidence\nshould establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and at times it is declared achieved.\nSkeptics and advocates of fideism admit that such proofs exist. The question is the\nsame as, would such proofs be acceptable to Descartes as valid? We do not quite\nknow what kind of proof would satisfy Descartes, and probably he himself did not\nknow that either. To restrict the discussion to mathematics will not do; he would not\nagree to this. Also, this would not help as controversy still surrounds the question,\nwhat are proofs in mathematics? Descartes did offer a criterion for valid proof, but it\nis unclear and by now abandoned. To be clear about what valid proof comprises, a\ntheory of proof is required. But then, naturally, whatever this theory will turn out to\nbe, it will be question-begging. It is this very observation that led to the ancient\nskeptic conclusion that proof is impossible. Hence [classical] rationality, too, is\nimpossible. So, the followers of Pyrrho, the Pyrrhonists, suggested that one should\nnever adopt any view, that one should always suspend judgment. Fideism is not any\nphilosophy that takes some initial axiom for granted: most philosophies do so.\nFideism is the endorsement of the skeptical critique of classical rationalism as\nlogically unassailable, plus the refusal to abide by the proposal to suspend all\njudgments or the observation that no one can follow this proposal. Advocates of\nfideism declare the only way out of skepticism the initial endorsement of some basic\naxiom prior to the acceptance of the rationalist canons of proof. Taking this last\nsentence seriously one may see that whether the proposals of Russell and of Popper\nare satisfactory or not, they have unquestionably rendered a great service by refuting\nthis fideist assertion: feasible or not, they show the existence of alternatives that are\nnot as arbitrary. They have thus sensitized us to the inconsistency of the advocates of\nfideism who defend their initial basic axioms, and even without stating them\nexplicitly.\n2. Between Fideism and Critical Rationalism\nThe question, which axiom to endorse, seems to advocates of fideism beside the\npoint: as the choice of an initial basic axiom is arbitrary in the sense that (for logical\nreasons) it is pre-rational and so not rational. Here some doubt as to the sincerity of\ncontrary notwithstanding.\nadvocates of fideism may be raised: how come they usually endorse the faith of their\nfathers, whatever this happens to be? They retort that this choice is the most\nconvenient. This sounds as if convenience is the supreme criterion of choice.\nMoreover, which choice is more convenient invites the investigations that they\nforego. One may try for comfort different initial basic axioms one after the other:\ntake as an initial axiom the thesis that repetition renders choice progressively\nintelligent and reasonable. This kind of conduct, and the decision to adopt it, is\nrational. The best variant of fideism, then, the one closest to the fideist own mode of\nreasoning, is to make a basic decision afresh each day. Advocates of fideism may\nreject this as it is inconvenient, but then, criteria for convenience as well as feels for\nit are no initial axioms and so they can be overruled. To conclude, even if fideism is\ntrue and an arbitrary choice of some initial axiom is required, it need not be final.\nSome existentialist philosophers say that a commitment to an initial axiom that is not\nlife-long is not serious. But to take seriousness as more compelling than intellectual\nprogress makes it one's initial basic axiom, and an inadmissible one at that, since it\nruns contrary to logic by blocking all criticism. Admitting this, however, demands\nthat every candidate for initial basic axiom should prove irrefutable.\nAdvocates of fideism ignore the range of choice of initial axioms to employ as\nthe basis of rational thought, possibly because most of them are traditionalists and\nonce they succeed to reconcile their traditional faith with rationalism they are content.\nIf so, then this is their initial basic axiom: they are traditionalists and rationalists. Is\ntheir choice arbitrary? Some of them endorse their traditions without examination;\nothers defend them in the name of social stability, and of these, Evans -Pritchard and\nothers, conclude that different traditions hold for different societies. They defend\nrationalism while rejecting the classical Cartesian hostility to tradition.\nAll this is conjecture, which is thus suspect, especially since finding any\nrationale to the fideist initial basic axiom deprives it of its arbitrariness and so of its\nvery fideism. But then, whenever advocates of fideism argue for their fusion of\ntradition and reason, they do so by defending their initial basic axiom \u2500 as arbitrary\nor otherwise \u2500 they are advocates of fideism no longer.\nMost non-religious advocates of fideism are pragmatists; they advocate faith in\nscience for practical reasons. This invites a careful distinction between pragmatists\nproper and pragmatist advocates of fideism: the former view usefulness as the basic\ncriterion for belief in any opinion; they deem utility the ground of belief: according\nto them rationality is not proof but usefulness. Hence, like Popper, they offer a non-\nclassical, theory of rationality and so they are not advocates of fideism at all. Hence,\nthe best criticism of pragmatism proper is the observation that in order to decide what\nidea is useful we need some workable criterion of rational decision between the\noptions that the choice of this or that hypothesis is most useful. Advocates of fideism\ndo not claim that utility or any other criterion is a criterion of rationality; rather, they\ntake it as the initial basic axiom that is chosen prior to being rational, as the\nprecondition for it; other than that, they adhere to the classical view of rationality as\nproof, and so the strong criticism of pragmatism just voiced does not apply to their\nview. One may, of course, suggest that the initial choice of rationality is not useful,\nbut this is an initial basic axiom, a dogma not subject to critical debate.\nToday taking science to be the most useful set of beliefs to advocate is\nextremely popular. Its popularity suggests that possibly behind it stands mental\nlaziness plus the hypothesis that following the majority is most convenient. This is no\nfideism. Nor is the thoughtless adherence to the majority view, nor is the view of one\nwho has never examined one\u2019s views and who does not know what exactly it is. It\nmay but need not be fideist proper. It is clear that these differ; the question is, does\nthis difference make a practical difference? A difference, to be a [real] difference,\nsaid arch-pragmatist William James, must make a [practical] difference. Is there a\npractical difference between pragmatism proper and pragmatist fideism?\nAt least this should be observed: the tu-quoque argument makes it clear that\nthose who use it view us all as advocates of fideism at heart, whether we know it or\nnot; and then even if everyone behave in the fideist manner, the advocates of fideism\nare still practically better off as they possess a greater self-awareness. But surely,\nwhether this is so or not is both forever question-begging and empirically decidable,\nwhich is absurd.\nPragmatists have replaced proof with utility as the criterion of rationality.\nOther criteria may be proof-substitutes too. Each of them may serve as an alternative\nto the classical theory of rationality or as a fideist basis for the quasi-classical one.\nThis depicts the whole scheme in a new way. For, now the question is generalized:\npragmatists or others who take utility or any other quality as their supreme criterion,\ndo they use it repeatedly and eschew proof proper, or do they use it initially and then\nrequire proof? Is theirs an alternative rationalist view or is it a quasi-rationalist one?\nThis is a big difference, as it is procedural and so it effects almost every deliberation:\ndeliberations may employ proof (though on the basis of an arbitrarily chosen axiom)\nand they may employ an altogether different criterion of rationality.\nThis reasoning may expose pragmatism as a version of fideism; it also exposes\nadvocates of fideism as rationalists for all intents and purpose, as long their initial\nbasic choice of rationalism is not challenged. Their discussions can, perhaps also\nshould, be scrutinized as to whether or not, in addition to their axioms, advocates of\nfideism usually advocate the demand for proof. Now, clearly, almost all discussions\nincorporate some initial hypotheses, except for Descartes' radical thought experiment\nand its alternatives, all of which are now judged unavoidably failures. Hence, there is\nno practical difference between the fideist mode of arguing and other, except for one:\nwhenever what they happen to consider their initial basic axioms happens to be\nchallenged, they refuse to discuss it. Here, all of a sudden, the tu-quoque argument\nbreaks down and drops out of the picture. Contrary to it, there is a basic difference\nbetween the fideist and others: we all exempt some dogma from the demand to\nexamine it rationally, but the advocates of fideism exempt their own dogma\nconsciously and systematically and for good. This is a great self-awareness, and one\nthat they might naturally take pride of. It turns out to be their awareness of their\nirrevocable commitment to a dogma, and as a necessity. But this turns out to be a\nmistake: there are better ways to handle the situation.\nThe very use of the tu-quoque argument rests on error: it is used as an excuse\nto exempt from rational scrutiny some unspecified view, on the basis of the\nobservation that usually we all do so (since the skeptic critique of classical\nrationalism is valid). But we all do so now and then, whereas advocates of fideism do\nso come-what-may. This is why the suggestion to keep one's initial axiom floating is\nso deadly to fideism; its hidden assumption is that their retreat to commitment is a\nleap of faith in the sense of Kierkegaard, as Bartley has discovered.\nBartley saw the situation this way: taking the tu-quoque argument as support\nfor fideism is placing it on the borderline between rationalism and irrationalism and\ninvites efforts to refute it: its refutation is required not for irrationalists but for\nrationalists. He was in error: the tu-quoque argument is but a variant on the skeptic\ncritique. Even were it unanswerable, it would remain better to take reason upon faith\nthan to be defensive about some proper dogma. This point belongs to Popper. It is\nlovely. In his effort to dodge Bartley\u2019s criticism he lost it. pity.\nThis is no defense of classical rationalism, of course, since the skeptic critique\nof it as question-begging is taken here as valid, even if only as a working hypothesis;\nthis is to dismiss the fideist critique as no boost for it. This dismissal holds equally\nfor classical rationalism and to any other variant. To make this evident, let us\nconsider the idea of the ancient Pyrrhonist school, the view that one can live w ithout\nadherence to any view, with total and permanent suspension of judgment, and that\nthe practice of the suspension of judgment provides peace of mind (ataraxia). This is\nquestionable, but let this ride and let us ask, is Pyrrhonism fideist? Possibly, as a\nmatter of fact, every school has an initial basic axiom. Even were this true, as neither\nschool has noted this, it is hard to decide which of the two schools is nearer to\nfideism, the Pyrrhonists or the classical rationalists. That there is a great practical\ndifference between them, however, is all too clear. Hence, the tu-quoque argument\nmakes no practical difference even between skeptics and classical rationalists, though\nthe skeptical argument clearly does.\nI know Popper and Bartle agreed that they d isagreed; I do not know on what.\nPerhaps Popper has offered a new comprehensive theory of rationality that is less\nquestion-begging than comprehensive classical rationalism, perhaps not; Bartley\nclaimed that he did and that Popper did not; but then perhaps both did and perhaps\nneither did. If both did, and if both did not, are the views of the two identical? For\nuncontested background information, the very demand for openness to criticism is\ntaken for granted. Popper\u2019s innovation that Bartley endorsed but that is still the\nminority view is the assertion that this demand suffices for rationality, including the\nrationality of science. Popper's theory of rationality is very far-reaching, and is far\nfrom obvious. Bartley found it admirable but defective in not being comprehensive.\n3. Between Popper and Bartley\nscience Adolf Gr\xfcnbaum who calls himself neo-Baconian and denies Popper his originality.\nWhereas classical rationalism broke down because it is comprehensive, fideism is\npainful because it is not. Hence, rejecting both amounts to rejectingwhat they share:\nthe idea that rationality is proof. Consider, then, critical rationalism, the idea that\nrationality is disproof. Can we not show both options of it, qualified and\ncomprehensive, likewise painful? Can we apply the skeptical argument to\ncomprehensive critical rationalism and find it wanting, and then to apply the\nrationalist critique of fideism to qualified critical rationalism, and then be done with\nit altogether? Let me defeat this program.\nConsider first the application of classical rationalism to critical rationalism\n(qualified or comprehensive). This way critical rationalism fails of course. This has\nbeen showed repeatedly in the literature, yet it is trivial. Moreover, this is offered as\nfatal criticism, yet it is no criticism at all: there is no reason why critical rationalism\nshould submit to the rules of classical rationalism. Should it be applied to itself\ninstead? That classical rationalism should be proven by its own light is clear. But\ncritical rationalism should be held open to criticism, perhaps, or else it should be\nqualified. Here possibly Popper and Bartley disagreed. What is the reasoning here?\nCan we discuss this matter without begging the question?\nThe claim that logic is obligatory is inherent in the history of the debate over\nrationality. Hence, it is not contested that the aim of criticism is to refute its object.\nFrom the very start Popper stressed that he never adjudicated the matter of the\nsuccess of each piece of criticism, that all he said in general was no more than what\nlogic requires: if and when a piece of criticism is judged successful, then it is thereby\nalso judged as having refuted its object. To repeat, Popper offers as a solution to the\nproblem of rationality not a logical truth, but a conjecture, the novel theory that\ndisproof suffices for the advancement of knowledge in general and of science in\nparticular. How does he know that disproof suffices? He does not; it is his conjecture.\nQuery: is it rational to advocate this presupposition, this initial basic axiom? Can\nthere be a critical debate of it? If not, it seems fideist; if yes, it seems comprehensive.\nWhich is it?\nAssume that we must choose some initial basic axiom; how can the choice be\nrational? Given Popper's theory of rationality as openness to criticism, the answer to\nthis question is obvious: to the extent that it is criticizable and open to criticism, it is.\nDoes this apply to Popper's own choice? Should a critical rationalist be open-minded\nabout being open-minded? This is hard to say. Let us try to do so by splitting critical\nrationalism into two theses, one minor, one major, so that the question splits into two\nas well. The minor thesis is that criticism is binding. Is it? In other words, is logic\nbinding? The major thesis is that disproof suffices for intellectual progress. Is it? Till\nnow adherence to logic was taken for granted; nevertheless, possibly, comprehensive\ncritical rationalism requires an examination of our commitment to logic.\nAlready Plato asked, how binding is logic? In the end of his Phaedo,\ndescribing Socrates' last minutes, he ascribes to him the refusal to give up reason;\nnothing, Socrates seems to say, will sway him away from logic: he will never be a\nmysologist: even in his last hour he will gladly accept criticism. It is hard to say\nwhether this reading of the text is right, since the question is intricate. But Popper's\ntext seemed to me clear enough \u2500 until he declared Bartley's reading of it erroneous:\nI then began to doubt my reading of his text. For a lark, however, let me cling to my\nold reading of his text, as examining a view is more important than its authorship.\n(Besides, the first author of qualified critical rationalism is anyway Plato or Heinrich\nHeine.) To avoid all misconception of my motive, let me repeat: this discussion is no\ndefense of Popper or of Bartley, since I dissent from both.\nPlato's insistence on open-mindedness, his refusal to be open-minded about it,\nseems to identify rationality with logic. This is not clear, especially since formal\nlogic was invented later, and since it was not satisfactory till the twentieth century, if\never. So logic was open to criticism. Is it still? If yes, can its authority be revoked? In\nother words, can there be a critical debate on the rationality of logic, and if it is found\ndefective, can it be taken for granted? This depends on what we mean by the demand\nto reject a refuted version of it. If it is the demand to improve logic, then yes; if it is\nthe demand to jettison it, then no. Hence, in the broad sense logic is not given to\nrational deliberations, and so it is the initial axiom of rationality. Yet, in the narrow\nsense logic is very much given to rational deliberations, and this is expressed in the\nperennial efforts to improve it. (This seems to be the major thrust of the critique of\nthe view of logic as above criticism that we usually ascribe to Van Quine.)\nThis holds for all possible versions of the theory of rationality, since, to repeat,\ndiscussion of it was always conducted within logic. And then, Popper's claim that\nrationality is not comprehensive can be seen (not as a concession to fideism but) as\nmaking explicit a point that was traditionally taken for granted and that the modern\nhistory of logic makes its explicit statement desirable: the broad commitment to logic\ninvites efforts at its improvement in detail. Once this is noted, the discussion of\ncomprehensiveness has to be recast in a more precise manner. For example, the\nadvocates of fideism' commitment to their tradition is less irrational if it is only a\nbroad commitment, while being open-minded about any detail of it. (This is no small\ndifference, as it replaces the refusal to engage in intellectual traffic between different\ntraditions with a proposal to have it, at least up to a point, but the point is movable.)\nPopper has advocated this attitude to tradition in his classic if neglected 1947\n&#34;Towards a Rational Theory of Tradition&#34; [Popper, 1963].\nWith more due care, then, Bartley's comprehensiveness may read, his\ncommitment to logic is rational since he is open to its critical assessment. The same\nholds for Popper, of course. Where, then, is the difference between qualified and\ncomprehensive critical rationalism? Perhaps the difference lies in the disagreement\nabout the major thesis, the thesis that the engagement in critical debates suffices for\nthe advancement of learning. Since criticism involves logic, the discussion of the\nmajor thesis involves the minor one, but we need not go over this ground again.\nSuppose that the thesis that criticism suffices for progress is refuted, then. What will\nthis suggest to critical rationalists? Again, it seems, it will invite an improvement, not\na total overthrow. This seems to be the attitude advocated and practiced by both\nattitudes. So how do they differ?\nThis is not an idle thought. Critical rationalism was criticized both ways: once\n\u2500 by Feyerabend and myself \u2500 with the observation that at times the suspension of\ncriticism (at least for a lark) is wise (as Popper admitted citing Galileo to that effect)\nand once \u2500 by myself \u2500 with the observation that scholasticism was critical but not\nprogressive. The reason for this defect is clear: scholastic criticism was conducted\nwithin a given framework that was not given to criticism; this was done consciously,\non the ground of the view that debates have to be limited by some initial basic axio m,\nvery much in the fideist manner. Popper was aware of this: in his early work he\ndemanded that the most theory most given to criticism should be examined first, and\nhe later criticized the scholastic theory, which he called &#34;the myth of the framework&#34;.\nHe was thus unclear if not inconsistent. The way to overcome the inconsistency is to\nspeak of maximal criticism instead of criticism when wording the thesis of critical\nrationalism. Popper suggested that the demand for maximal openness to criticism\nwill eliminate, or at least sufficiently prevent, the use of ad hoc hypotheses, as there\nreduce the level of openness to criticism of hypotheses.\nExcept that this was criticized too \u2500 also by myself. Many theories in\ntechnology are very open to criticism yet are very much ad hoc; efforts to put them to\ntest are made repeatedly, as they are of great technological value. Yet they are not\ndeemed intellectually as interesting as the scarcely testable theories that are on the\nforefront of theoretical research. Since critical rationalism does not differentiate\nbetween pure and applied research, it demands improvement. This holds for Popper\nand for Bartley equally.\nSince qualified critical rationalism demands openness to criticism not only in\nthe abstract but also as exhibited in the possibility of a concrete criticism, in the high\nrisk of the theory in question, Bartley could ask Popper, how great should this risk be\nbefore it is deemed great enough? Popper had an answer to this question already in\n1935, but only as far as science is concerned: the risk is measured there by the\nlikelihood of an experiment that can be designed and performed to refute the theory\nin question; this likelihood can be measured by some extant alternative or by\ncommon sense. But Popper himself admitted in 1945 that weaker kinds of criticism\nare possible, in history and in philosophy, including ethics. How much should the\nrisk be a real one? (Significantly, Bartley took seriously the weak criticism that\npseudo-intellectual sects directed against the established commonwealth of learning.\nHe suggested [Bartley, 1990, 100] that since the academy is so very dogmatic, these\nfleeting intellectual clusters are where the action really is. This view is intriguing but\nalas not serious.) Nor is that all. Popper spent much of his effort arguing that\ncriticism is beneficial, which should be incontestable, and that the theory of\nrationality as the critical attitude does not suffer from the skeptical critique. Bartley\non his part spent much time arguing that since critical rationalism is not hit by the\nskeptic critique it can be held comprehensively. But they both argued prematurely,\noverlooking the critical examination of the claim that they perform the task for which\nthey were designed.\nThe question that the classical theory of rationality came to answer is, what\ntheory should be believed? Critical rationalists refuse to answer this question, as it\nprefers the diversity of opinions. Rather, it comes to exclude the theories that are not\nreasonable to believe, beginning with traditional local myths. The wish to promote\nthe progress of science is better than the wish to believe in current science. Proof\ndoes not do it; does disproof? No; critical rationalism never guaranteed success. Can\nit at least explain success? No; explanation amounts to guarantee: to say that A is\ncaused by B is to guarantee the presence of A in the presence of B. Critical\nrationalism guarantees not the success in providing conjectures and their criticism,\nbut that when these are present, progress obtains. How? The answer is what makes\ncritical rationalism so very intriguing: criticism is not the cause of intellectual\nprogress; it is intellectual progress. This, however, is a new conception of progress,\nand it can be challenged. We have not shed light this way on an important matter:\nwhy is the Popper-Bartley dispute important? In answer to this Bartley said,\nerroneously, because the tu-quoque argument is a serious challenge. This challenge\nmay signify at most for critical rationalism, not for science proper.\n4. Rationality as Partial and as Social\nWe see again that the discussion requires better presentation. Let us begin with\nrationality, whatever it is. Rationality as proof is an all-or-nothing affair; criticism is\npossibly more graded. Consider it a matter of degree. I. C. Jarvie and I have\nintroduced this idea decades ago. The measure of the degree of rationality, we\nsuggest, is not some abstract scale but depends on the available intellectual tools. It is\nclear, we said, that for one living in a preliterate society the most rational act and\nattitude will be much inferior to that available to one living in a society familiar with\nscience. This enters the social dimens ion into the debate, and so it really needs going\nover and, when necessary, recast. This is no small matter. Traditionally the options\navailable to social philosophy were individualism and collectivism. As collectivism\nnaturally distrusts individual reason as disruptive, it tends to be irrationalist.\nIndividualism then ruled the debate on rationality. And as individuals depend on\nsociety to this or that extent, though not wholly, their rationality should be cast in\nsocial terms and then viewed as partial.\nTo take a simple example, whereas traditional advocates of fideism discussed\nthe matter of rationality in an individualist framework, they could hardly answer the\nquestion, how should I choose my initial axioms? They did not have clear instances\nof initial axioms, and it looked as if infinitely many alternatives are available. Asking\nthe question in a social manner it becomes the question of the choice of a community,\nand there are a few communities to join; moreover, one cannot change communities\nevery week, and so, for merely technical reasons, one must live on one so as to\nacquire is basic tenets. It was stressed by Michael Polanyi, that when one joins a\ncommunity one scarcely knows what it has to offer, especially if the community in\nquestion is the scientific community, and that when one learns the initial basic\naxioms one may find that they are not given to simple articulation. He stressed,\nhowever, that one can belong to more than one community without fear of\ncontradiction. He did not elaborate. Another historical example should serve as\nevidence of the defect of the abstract discussion that Popper still participated in: the\nold scholastic tradition is not considered as rational as the new scientific tradition\n(even on the supposition that the old gave birth to the young). I skip the details here.\nAs long as science plays the role of a paradigm of rational activity, the\nindividual is most rational when joining the scientific community. Popper has\nsuggested that science is a social institution, one that encourages criticism. He also\nsuggested that parliamentary democracy is such a paradigm, and the same holds for\nthat paradigm. That there may be inconsistency between science and democracy, as\nwell as within each, is no reason for defection, as it may be a challenge for efforts to\nimprove. Popper said, the reason for these being paradigms of rationality is that\nrationality is the effort to improve through criticism.\nCan we rephrase the Popper-Bartley dispute within a social framework? All\ntheories of rationality recommend joining actively the life of science and of\ndemocracy. The view of rationality as improvable goes better with critical\nrationalism than with classical rationalism. Is here a significant difference between\nPopper and Bartley? Can we rephrase Bartley's philosophy socially? I do not know.\nThe critical attitude commends both a personal openness to criticism and an\ninstitutional setup that encourages criticism and is open to reform. The criticism of an\ninstitution, or of an institutionalized opinion, however, is not the same as the\ncriticism of an individual's opinion: the one is a personal matter, the other is social.\nValid criticism should always lead one to the search of alternatives, and reform is\naccepted not after criticism is voiced and endorsed but after a viable alternative is\nfound and tested in instituted manners. What this means for Popper is clear enough:\nboth democracy and science are open to reform. What does this mean for Bartley\nabove and beyond what it means to Popper I cannot see. Perhaps this means that\npossibly democracy and/or science will be criticized in a new manner that will lead\nto a proposal of a totally new regime and/or research protocol and Bartley will be\nwilling to test it. Whether this is so or not is hard to say: the discussion becomes too\nabstract here.\nBibliography\nAgassi, Joseph, 1981.

 u"Giuseppe Franco, editor, Der Kritische Rationalismus als Denkmethode und\nLebensweise: Festscrhift zum 90. Geburtstag von Hans Albert. Klagenfurt: Kitab,\n2012, 34-55\nCritical Rationalism, Comprehensive or Qualified:\nThe Popper-Bartley Dispute\nBy Joseph Agassi,\nTel-Aviv University and York University, Toronto\n0. Background.\nKarl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945,\nCh. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason.\nLater on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and\neven called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to\nhis annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave,\n1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter\nis very complicated. Let me show this now.\nFideism is a minimal retreat from classical rationalism. As this theory is\ncomprehensive in its demand for proof as ultimate justification, it begs the question\nof its own justification. All parties to the current dispute admit that this is a defect\nthat has no cure except by some modification. To that end adherents to fideism\nadvocate some axiom taken on faith as the minimum necessary concession to\nirrationalism. The rationalism that the advocates of fideism qualify is the classical\ntheory of rationality, that is, to be precise, an assertion plus a demand. The theory is,\nrationality equals proof. The demand is to make an assertion \u2013 or to endorse it, to\nbelieve it \u2013 if and only if proof is available that the assertion is true. As the skeptics\nhave shown, any proof of any (synthetic) assertion requires a proof theory that\nrequires proof in its turn. (The possibly of proof in logic and in mathematics has no\nplace in the present discussion.) The skeptics have then recommended holding no\nbelief, making no definite assertion, holding all views only tentatively. Skeptics\nclaim that they have a proof that no proof is possible that should satisfy classical\nrationalists. Most rationalists have invested much effort in attempts to find fault in\nthat proof, and they are still trying. As this essay concerns the dispute between\nPopper and Bartley, who both endorse the skeptic proof, we may take the skeptical\nproof for granted. Hence, the classical theory of rationality cannot stay as it is. The\nadvocates of fideism conclude, then, that some retreat is imperative. The minimal\ndeviation is an assertion that advocates of fideism recommend to endorse without\nproof. That is to say, they recommend its endorsement upon faith. There are two\nstandard candidates for that assertion: the principle of induction and the faith of one\u2019s\nforefathers.\nOf course, not all deviation from the classical theory of rationality is fideist.\nSince advocates of fideism propose that the deviation from the old view should be\nminimal, it is hard to see how this proposal is contestable. An obvious point to\ncontest concerns the question, what deviation is minimal. On this Popper has made a\nbrilliant alternative proposal. Although it has not gained popularity among advocates\nof fideism, it is obviously the best thus far offered. It is this. The least concession\nshould not be the faith in any principle of induction, much less in a given traditional\nfaith, but preferably in the possibility that rational debate may generate progress.\nAdvocates of fideism may object to this obviously superior proposal: it accompanies\na lower standard of rationality. Whereas the classical theory of rationality equates\nrationality with proof, Popper\u2019s theory equates rationality with the critical attitude.\nWhat is preferable, one irrational axiom or this reduction of the standard? The\nanswer is that the reduction of the standard is necessary anyway since the skeptical\ncriticism of traditional rationalism is valid. (Thus, Bertrand Russell advocated the\nadoption of some principle of induction upon faith in the hope that it will suffice to\njustify current science [Russell, 1992, 38]; [Russell, 1996, 313-28]. He did not\nmanage to formulate it explicitly.)\nPopper has proposed two brilliant minimizing moves: of the standard of\nrationality and of the concession to irrationalism. Bartley has shown that there is no\nneed for the two moves, as one will do. This he proved conclusively: reducing the\nstandard of rationality renders a concession unnecessary. It is a shame that Popper\nhas not admitted this, suggesting instead that Bartley just improved the wording of\nwhat he had intended to advocate all along: he denied that he made the mistake that\nBartley had attributed to him. It is likewise a shame that Bartley conflated his valid\ncriticism of Popper with his own alternative to it: only the criticism, not the\nalternative to the criticized theory, is uncontestable. The errors on both sides led to an\nimpasse. In desperation, Bartley called Popper a fideist, and Popper took offence. My\naim here is to rectify these two errors and thus restore the peace between their ghosts.\nNow the fideism that Bartley has saddled Popper with is at the very least not\nthe traditional version but an improvement on it. It says, welcome critical scrutiny as\nprogressive. If this is a version of fideism, then it is an admirable version of it. Both\nPopper and Bartley have confused this idea, be it a version of fideism or not, with a\nslightly greater demand: do not advocate a theory unless it has passed critical\nscrutiny. This version of rationalism, be it fideist or not, both Popper and Bartley\nrejected, and rightly so, despite its superiority over the more traditional versions of\nfideism. Regrettably they did not praise it before rejecting it, although by the canons\nof criticism they should have.\nTaking for granted here the skeptical criticism of traditional rationalism, let us\nconsider the question, which modification of it is right? Considering any proposed\nmodification, why should we adopt it? To take it upon faith has all the defects of\nfideism without its advantage (of being a minimal concession). For the sake of the\nargument, let us agree to prefer the modification that is the smallest concession to\nirrationalism. What is it? And is that preferable to the original fideist view? And\nworse, how are we to adjudicate on this without begging the question? Still worse,\nwhatever answer to this question that we may offer, will it not remain fideist at heart?\nBartley acutely observed that when Popper said that his proposal (to takes the\nfaith in reason on faith) is a deviation from rationalism, he was in error (or at the very\nleast unclear): the deviation is from classical, not from critical rationalism: applied to\nitself, classical rationalism does not live by its own precepts (it begs the question);\napplied to itself, critical rationalism may live by its own precepts, at least possibly so.\nSo far this criticism of Bartley is obviously right, and Popper should have\nacknowledged its validity. Unfortunately this did not happen. Partly it was Popper\u2019s\nfailing, partly it was a confusion that rested on the fact that Bartley had his own view\nof critical rationalism that Popper had all the right to reject \u2013 but not before admitting\nthe validity of Bartley\u2019s criticism.\nFor my own part, I am no party to this dispute [Agassi, 1981, 72, 100, 465-71,\n474, 476]. My aim here is not to take sides but to clarify it and perhaps to remove the\nvery ground for it. I reject the framework within which it takes place. My alternative\nto that framework is the idea that rationalism is a working hypothesis. Thus it is\nneither a basis for rational thought nor an object of faith, but simply an assumption\nthat facilitate rational deliberations. It seems to me that on second thought both\nPopper and Bartley would have agreed. They could object that I have not said what\nrational deliberation is, but here I defer to their own views on it, which are quite\ntraditional and also sufficiently unproblematic to serve as the default option.\nMy effort to neutralize a dispute may sound like an exercise in the tradition of\nlogical positivism. It is not. For, it replaces a metaphysical framework with a better\none, and it does not destroy a problem but replaces it with a better alternative, much\nin the tradition of critical rationalism. Thus, needless to say, I ascribe my alternative\nto Popper and Bartley and take their input as either propaedeutic (preparatory) or the\nlong way around, as you like it.\n1. The hyper-stable working hypothesis\nWhat characterizes a working hypothesis most is its fluidity: there is no commitment\nand hardly any reason to it: its adoption is for a lark. One may even take it on a whim,\nthough on occasion it is common sense. And what one takes on a whim is ephemeral,\nof course. Still, some working hypotheses stay, for good reasons or bad. My concern\nis with a working hypothesis that is hyper-stable. So let me show first that these exist.\nMy claim is that this stability is the most general characteristic of any reasonable\nview of duty. So please be patient.\nWe act voluntarily yet under constraints. Classical liberal thinkers often said,\nin principle there is no difference between free and coerced action. Nevertheless, one\ndifference matters, between keenness and reluctance: we may act reluctantly out of a\nsense of duty. Of course, classical liberal thinkers viewed duty-bound conduct as not\npeculiar, as it is up to us to decide to behave morally, so that we always act\nvoluntarily. Nevertheless, the difference between the fulfillment of one\u2019s own\ninterest and that of others is a matter of principle. This is particularly so in cases of\nacts with unlikely consequences. When we face options that are not likely to yield\nfruits, we tend to adopt choices that are easiest: the game is not worth the candle, we\nmay say to ourselves and quit. Yet when the game is obligatory, this is unacceptable.\nMany moral acts are unlikely to have worthy consequences, yet were that a sufficient\nexcuse for quitting a task allows us to be socially apathetic and even asocial. When it\ncomes to affairs of other people and more so to public affairs, as the duty of hope we\nshould grant the Good Lord the benefit of doubt [Agassi, 1999, 50-4, 124-5]. In our\nown affairs we may be more realistic. Hence, whereas optimism as an opinion is\nfoolish, as an attitude it is just right and often even obligatory.\nThis is a peculiarity of action out of duty as opposed to one out of self-interest,\nand so classical liberal theory is wanting. Its error rested, indeed, on an optimist\nassessment of the outcome of the broad application of rationality: optimist\nassessments prevent the appearance of the difference in attitude that morality\nprescribes between satisfying the personal interests and those of others . World War II\nexposed this optimism as an error. It matters not whether the error was in the\nassessment of the ease with which rationality would be broadly applicable or in the\nassessment of its outcome. What matters is that the optimist assessment of the\noutcome of our actions is no longer the default option, and that it should stay\nnonetheless as an assumption for our actions \u2013 as a stable working hypothesis.\nA dreadful example for this is the conduct of the Jewish leadership, especially\nthe Zionist leadership in the United States of America during the Holocaust. They\nsabotaged efforts to rescue the Jews of Europe [Agassi, 1999, Ch. 15]. Now they say,\nthey knew these efforts were hopeless. This is a mere excuse, not only because\nrecords available now refute this assessment, but also and more so because a priori\nsuch assessments may be false. Still, admittedly, at the time the assessment was bleak\nand it was reasonable (though erroneous). This example may be poor. This is of little\nconsequence, since alternative examples are easily available.\nThe hypothesis that we may make a difference should serve as a hyper-stable\nworking hypothesis. It is my alternative to the ideas of Popper and of Bartley about\nthe choice of a theory of rationality. Let me explain.\n2. Between Classical Rationalism and Fideism\nThe starting point here, to repeat, is the admission of the skeptical criticism of the\nclassical theory of rationality: proof is impossible. Advocates of irrationalis m often\nuse this criticism as the rationale for their rejection of all theories of rationality and\nof all proposal and demand to behave rationally. Those who reject the classical\ntheory but wish to adopt another add some adjective to the name of the theory of\nrationality to differentiate it from a theory that they might endorse. The adjectives\noften used are &#34;traditional&#34;, &#34;classical&#34; and &#34;Cartesian&#34;; Karl Popper suggested\n&#34;comprehensive&#34;, since the classical version advocates the comprehensive demand to\naffirm no view ever except proven ones.\nBeing comprehensive, classical rationalism demands to jettison all of familiar\nideas, so that the learning venture should begin afresh with no assumptions, with a\nclean slate, and with utterly open minds. In brief, classical rationalism is radical.\nDescartes attempted to apply it in his celebrated thought experiment, performed in\nthe hope that starting afresh guarantees the establishment of a true, scientific image\nof the world. He failed, as did all of his disciples.\nThe classical theory of rationality bumps into two interlocking standard\nobjections. The first is the classical skeptical argument: proof is question-begging.\nAn obvious logical way to overcome this is by the admission of some sufficiently\nstrong initial basic axiom. The standard examples are, the principle of the simplicity\nof nature, or of limited variety, or of induction. Some other axioms are available as\nwell. Their adherents defend their choices with a new argument that exposes the\ncomprehensiveness of classical rationalism as further weakness: the principle,\nwhatever it is, requires the assumption that it suffices for the development of a\nrational worldview and of science as we know it. This added assumption repeatedly\nmeets with a refutation that exposes the proposed principle as not good enough.\nConsider then the opposite extreme: irrationalism. Its advocates recommend\ngiving up rationality; this fascinates those who find the irrational attractive, appealing,\noverpowering: they are tired of rationality. They are intentionally unreasonable,\nforgetting that the intellect is the most powerful instrument that Nature has put at the\ndisposal of humanity, and the refusal to use it is lamentable. The advantage of\nunreason, however, is that it is license for the use of poor arguments. Those who use\nthis license denounce logic as perverse, as opposed to human natural healthy instincts,\nor to tradition or to traditional religion, or to whatever else they may advance as\nsuperior to reason. Yet, as a mere working hypothesis, this reveals some interesting\nideas. Prominent among these is the view of the first irrationalist, Heraclitus, the\nfamous pre-Socratic thinker, who probably reacted to the first version of rationalism,\nthat of Parmenides. Plato's Socrates called irrationalists mysologists, the haters of\nlogic (Phaido). Despite this hatred Heraclitus offered some valuable criticism of\nrationalism and some new ideas. Nevertheless, here let us dismiss misology.\nIrrationalists need not giving up the use of the intellect. Its use does not require\nany recognition of it as an authority over all thought processes \u2013 it can be useful\nwithout being authoritative in any way. Hence, irrationalists may have a choice in\nspecifying what portion of their thought process the intellect is not to control, as long\nas the choice does not intervene with their ability to use logic, even with a vengeance,\nin areas deemed well within the province of reason, such as mathematics and physics\nand their practical applications. What then is the suggestion to limit rationality?\nWhere exactly does rationality cease to adjudicate? The irrationalist literature has\nmany answers to this question that serve well as merely working hypotheses.\nThe better of the disenchanted with classical rationalism distinguish between\nthe criticism of the classical theory of rationality that all of them endorse and the idea\non which they disagree as to what to place outside the domain of the intellect. They\nrightly insist that the latter is less important than the former, since it leads them to\nagree that some presupposition, no matter what, must obtain with no rational basis,\nno matter upon what other kind of basis it might rest; indeed, they may add, one may\nendorse quite arbitrarily any presupposition as the initial basic axiom for rationality.\nSome presuppositions are so useless that they are overlooked. (For example, the\nassertion that Superman exists will be obviously utterly useless here.) They\nadvocated arbitrary presuppositions are usually far from being satisfactory too, but as\nworking hypotheses they may be handy and when one fails its advocate may abandon\nit for another. Of course, being irrationalists they may also cling to it dogmatically.\nAn example of this dogmatism is collectivism, made popular by \xc9mile\nDurkheim, one of the two acknowledged fathers of modern sociology. Most\nirrationalists endorse collectivism dogmatically, despite its obvious defects; they take\nas their initial basic axiom tradition, religious or national, or some authority,\nintellectual or political, or any other item that they declare vital for the maintenance\nof social stability. Their basic axiom then is that society with no stability is too\nobjectionable to take seriously into consideration as a viable option. This is sad, but\nthere are sad options on the opposite side too, namely on the side of individualism.\nAs a stable working hypothesis this is very common in the social sciences. It is\nespecially popular as Max Weber, the other of the two acknowledged fathers of\nmodern sociology. He took as the initial basic axiom for rationality a personal faith.\nThis is the source of the label \u201cfideism\u201d (&#34;fideo&#34; means, I believe). Advocates of\nfideism stress the logical impossibility of rationalism as long as it is comprehensive,\nand the need to choose an initial basic axiom in order to reinstate it. Assuming\nnothing, one has no reason to activate the project of developing rationalism and a\nrational worldview. This is the so-called &#34;the tu-quoque argument&#34; (meaning, you\ntoo): comprehensive rationalism is impossible, therefore, rationalism too rests on an\ninitial basic axiom, namely, that rationality is at all possible and desirable.\nRather than ask, what did Weber use for proof, let us examine the tu-quoque\nargument. Supposing that it is valid; does this support fideism? Does it exonerate the\nutter arbitrariness (absence of logic) of the choice of an initial basic axiom? It does\nnot sound right. Most advocates of fideism believe in their tradition and Weber hated\ntradition and expressed faith in science. This observation is so obvious that we must\nascribe its neglect to its being taken for granted: of course, the initial basic axiom has\nto be sufficiently rich in content to enable it to save rationalism from its initial\npredicament. That we take this constraint for granted is obvious, yet the systematic\nneglect of its articulation is a remiss, since there is an obvious need to specify its\nfeatures and discuss them. Now, how should we decide whether our chosen initial\nbasic axiom is strong enough? Should it perhaps also be not too strong? And then,\neven if we find that our chosen axiom is strong enough but not too strong, then we\nmay ask, is it unique? If it is, then we can eschew fideism even in the light of the tu-\nquoque argument \u2013 as unnecessary: the constraint to classical rationalism imposed on\nit by the tu-quoque argument then leaves no room for any arbitrariness and it then\nbecomes eminently rational as the most efficient means to rescue rationality.\nThis move is very welcome, as it dispenses with the most undesirable corollary\nto fideism, namely, the claim that there are different and equally legitimate kinds of\nrationalism, depending on one's pre-logical choice of one's initial basic axiom, and\nthat the validity of each is constrained by its alternatives. What is said here may be\ntrue or false, but it is a way out of the predicament of classical rationalism that is not\nfideist in the usual sense of the word, as it employs the tu-quoque argument without\nconceding the arbitrary choice of any axiom.\nThe undesirable corollary just mentioned was praised by the great fideist and\nmystic anthropologist Sir Edward Evans-Pritchard as most desirable. This makes his\nfideism not so arbitrary. Any defense of the choice of an initial basic axiom will then\nbe rational. And then it is better to take as the initial basic axiom Russell's celebrated\nproposal.  Another proposal, perhaps even better, was introduced by Popper in\nChapter 24 of his classic The Open Society and Its Enemies of 1945: the belief that\ncriticism bespeaks progress. He called this &#34;the faith in reason&#34; and characterized it\nas the minimal required deviation from comprehensive rationalism. Russell hoped\nthat his a priori supposition would permit reinstatement of classical rationalism in\nsome attenuation; Popper offered a fully-fledged new theory of rationality as\ndisproof. If any suggestion for an initial basic axiom is acceptable, then a theory of\nrationality is possible such that it is neither classical nor fideist, and this regardless of\nwhether the proof or disproof is taken to be the criterion of rationality. The claim is\nthat the arbitrariness of the initial choice does not follow from the tu-quoque\nargument, so that it can be made quite rationally.\nIf classical rationalism is to be fully restored, however, it is not enough to\nqualify it rationally: proof has to be shown possible. If it is, then an example will\nestablish this possibility. Is there any? It is easy to adduce proofs, and even of diverse\nkinds, mathematical, scientific, and legal: for convictions in murder trials evidence\nshould establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and at times it is declared achieved.\nSkeptics and advocates of fideism admit that such proofs exist. The question is the\nsame as, would such proofs be acceptable to Descartes as valid? We do not quite\nknow what kind of proof would satisfy Descartes, and probably he himself did not\nknow that either. To restrict the discussion to mathematics will not do; he would not\nagree to this. Also, this would not help as controversy still surrounds the question,\nwhat are proofs in mathematics? Descartes did offer a criterion for valid proof, but it\nis unclear and by now abandoned. To be clear about what valid proof comprises, a\ntheory of proof is required. But then, naturally, whatever this theory will turn out to\nbe, it will be question-begging. It is this very observation that led to the ancient\nskeptic conclusion that proof is impossible. Hence [classical] rationality, too, is\nimpossible. So, the followers of Pyrrho, the Pyrrhonists, suggested that one should\nnever adopt any view, that one should always suspend judgment. Fideism is not any\nphilosophy that takes some initial axiom for granted: most philosophies do so.\nFideism is the endorsement of the skeptical critique of classical rationalism as\nlogically unassailable, plus the refusal to abide by the proposal to suspend all\njudgments or the observation that no one can follow this proposal. Advocates of\nfideism declare the only way out of skepticism the initial endorsement of some basic\naxiom prior to the acceptance of the rationalist canons of proof. Taking this last\nsentence seriously one may see that whether the proposals of Russell and of Popper\nare satisfactory or not, they have unquestionably rendered a great service by refuting\nthis fideist assertion: feasible or not, they show the existence of alternatives that are\nnot as arbitrary. They have thus sensitized us to the inconsistency of the advocates of\nfideism who defend their initial basic axioms, and even without stating them\nexplicitly.\n2. Between Fideism and Critical Rationalism\nThe question, which axiom to endorse, seems to advocates of fideism beside the\npoint: as the choice of an initial basic axiom is arbitrary in the sense that (for logical\nreasons) it is pre-rational and so not rational. Here some doubt as to the sincerity of\ncontrary notwithstanding.\nadvocates of fideism may be raised: how come they usually endorse the faith of their\nfathers, whatever this happens to be? They retort that this choice is the most\nconvenient. This sounds as if convenience is the supreme criterion of choice.\nMoreover, which choice is more convenient invites the investigations that they\nforego. One may try for comfort different initial basic axioms one after the other:\ntake as an initial axiom the thesis that repetition renders choice progressively\nintelligent and reasonable. This kind of conduct, and the decision to adopt it, is\nrational. The best variant of fideism, then, the one closest to the fideist own mode of\nreasoning, is to make a basic decision afresh each day. Advocates of fideism may\nreject this as it is inconvenient, but then, criteria for convenience as well as feels for\nit are no initial axioms and so they can be overruled. To conclude, even if fideism is\ntrue and an arbitrary choice of some initial axiom is required, it need not be final.\nSome existentialist philosophers say that a commitment to an initial axiom that is not\nlife-long is not serious. But to take seriousness as more compelling than intellectual\nprogress makes it one's initial basic axiom, and an inadmissible one at that, since it\nruns contrary to logic by blocking all criticism. Admitting this, however, demands\nthat every candidate for initial basic axiom should prove irrefutable.\nAdvocates of fideism ignore the range of choice of initial axioms to employ as\nthe basis of rational thought, possibly because most of them are traditionalists and\nonce they succeed to reconcile their traditional faith with rationalism they are content.\nIf so, then this is their initial basic axiom: they are traditionalists and rationalists. Is\ntheir choice arbitrary? Some of them endorse their traditions without examination;\nothers defend them in the name of social stability, and of these, Evans -Pritchard and\nothers, conclude that different traditions hold for different societies. They defend\nrationalism while rejecting the classical Cartesian hostility to tradition.\nAll this is conjecture, which is thus suspect, especially since finding any\nrationale to the fideist initial basic axiom deprives it of its arbitrariness and so of its\nvery fideism. But then, whenever advocates of fideism argue for their fusion of\ntradition and reason, they do so by defending their initial basic axiom \u2500 as arbitrary\nor otherwise \u2500 they are advocates of fideism no longer.\nMost non-religious advocates of fideism are pragmatists; they advocate faith in\nscience for practical reasons. This invites a careful distinction between pragmatists\nproper and pragmatist advocates of fideism: the former view usefulness as the basic\ncriterion for belief in any opinion; they deem utility the ground of belief: according\nto them rationality is not proof but usefulness. Hence, like Popper, they offer a non-\nclassical, theory of rationality and so they are not advocates of fideism at all. Hence,\nthe best criticism of pragmatism proper is the observation that in order to decide what\nidea is useful we need some workable criterion of rational decision between the\noptions that the choice of this or that hypothesis is most useful. Advocates of fideism\ndo not claim that utility or any other criterion is a criterion of rationality; rather, they\ntake it as the initial basic axiom that is chosen prior to being rational, as the\nprecondition for it; other than that, they adhere to the classical view of rationality as\nproof, and so the strong criticism of pragmatism just voiced does not apply to their\nview. One may, of course, suggest that the initial choice of rationality is not useful,\nbut this is an initial basic axiom, a dogma not subject to critical debate.\nToday taking science to be the most useful set of beliefs to advocate is\nextremely popular. Its popularity suggests that possibly behind it stands mental\nlaziness plus the hypothesis that following the majority is most convenient. This is no\nfideism. Nor is the thoughtless adherence to the majority view, nor is the view of one\nwho has never examined one\u2019s views and who does not know what exactly it is. It\nmay but need not be fideist proper. It is clear that these differ; the question is, does\nthis difference make a practical difference? A difference, to be a [real] difference,\nsaid arch-pragmatist William James, must make a [practical] difference. Is there a\npractical difference between pragmatism proper and pragmatist fideism?\nAt least this should be observed: the tu-quoque argument makes it clear that\nthose who use it view us all as advocates of fideism at heart, whether we know it or\nnot; and then even if everyone behave in the fideist manner, the advocates of fideism\nare still practically better off as they possess a greater self-awareness. But surely,\nwhether this is so or not is both forever question-begging and empirically decidable,\nwhich is absurd.\nPragmatists have replaced proof with utility as the criterion of rationality.\nOther criteria may be proof-substitutes too. Each of them may serve as an alternative\nto the classical theory of rationality or as a fideist basis for the quasi-classical one.\nThis depicts the whole scheme in a new way. For, now the question is generalized:\npragmatists or others who take utility or any other quality as their supreme criterion,\ndo they use it repeatedly and eschew proof proper, or do they use it initially and then\nrequire proof? Is theirs an alternative rationalist view or is it a quasi-rationalist one?\nThis is a big difference, as it is procedural and so it effects almost every deliberation:\ndeliberations may employ proof (though on the basis of an arbitrarily chosen axiom)\nand they may employ an altogether different criterion of rationality.\nThis reasoning may expose pragmatism as a version of fideism; it also exposes\nadvocates of fideism as rationalists for all intents and purpose, as long their initial\nbasic choice of rationalism is not challenged. Their discussions can, perhaps also\nshould, be scrutinized as to whether or not, in addition to their axioms, advocates of\nfideism usually advocate the demand for proof. Now, clearly, almost all discussions\nincorporate some initial hypotheses, except for Descartes' radical thought experiment\nand its alternatives, all of which are now judged unavoidably failures. Hence, there is\nno practical difference between the fideist mode of arguing and other, except for one:\nwhenever what they happen to consider their initial basic axioms happens to be\nchallenged, they refuse to discuss it. Here, all of a sudden, the tu-quoque argument\nbreaks down and drops out of the picture. Contrary to it, there is a basic difference\nbetween the fideist and others: we all exempt some dogma from the demand to\nexamine it rationally, but the advocates of fideism exempt their own dogma\nconsciously and systematically and for good. This is a great self-awareness, and one\nthat they might naturally take pride of. It turns out to be their awareness of their\nirrevocable commitment to a dogma, and as a necessity. But this turns out to be a\nmistake: there are better ways to handle the situation.\nThe very use of the tu-quoque argument rests on error: it is used as an excuse\nto exempt from rational scrutiny some unspecified view, on the basis of the\nobservation that usually we all do so (since the skeptic critique of classical\nrationalism is valid). But we all do so now and then, whereas advocates of fideism do\nso come-what-may. This is why the suggestion to keep one's initial axiom floating is\nso deadly to fideism; its hidden assumption is that their retreat to commitment is a\nleap of faith in the sense of Kierkegaard, as Bartley has discovered.\nBartley saw the situation this way: taking the tu-quoque argument as support\nfor fideism is placing it on the borderline between rationalism and irrationalism and\ninvites efforts to refute it: its refutation is required not for irrationalists but for\nrationalists. He was in error: the tu-quoque argument is but a variant on the skeptic\ncritique. Even were it unanswerable, it would remain better to take reason upon faith\nthan to be defensive about some proper dogma. This point belongs to Popper. It is\nlovely. In his effort to dodge Bartley\u2019s criticism he lost it. pity.\nThis is no defense of classical rationalism, of course, since the skeptic critique\nof it as question-begging is taken here as valid, even if only as a working hypothesis;\nthis is to dismiss the fideist critique as no boost for it. This dismissal holds equally\nfor classical rationalism and to any other variant. To make this evident, let us\nconsider the idea of the ancient Pyrrhonist school, the view that one can live w ithout\nadherence to any view, with total and permanent suspension of judgment, and that\nthe practice of the suspension of judgment provides peace of mind (ataraxia). This is\nquestionable, but let this ride and let us ask, is Pyrrhonism fideist? Possibly, as a\nmatter of fact, every school has an initial basic axiom. Even were this true, as neither\nschool has noted this, it is hard to decide which of the two schools is nearer to\nfideism, the Pyrrhonists or the classical rationalists. That there is a great practical\ndifference between them, however, is all too clear. Hence, the tu-quoque argument\nmakes no practical difference even between skeptics and classical rationalists, though\nthe skeptical argument clearly does.\nI know Popper and Bartle agreed that they d isagreed; I do not know on what.\nPerhaps Popper has offered a new comprehensive theory of rationality that is less\nquestion-begging than comprehensive classical rationalism, perhaps not; Bartley\nclaimed that he did and that Popper did not; but then perhaps both did and perhaps\nneither did. If both did, and if both did not, are the views of the two identical? For\nuncontested background information, the very demand for openness to criticism is\ntaken for granted. Popper\u2019s innovation that Bartley endorsed but that is still the\nminority view is the assertion that this demand suffices for rationality, including the\nrationality of science. Popper's theory of rationality is very far-reaching, and is far\nfrom obvious. Bartley found it admirable but defective in not being comprehensive.\n3. Between Popper and Bartley\nscience Adolf Gr\xfcnbaum who calls himself neo-Baconian and denies Popper his originality.\nWhereas classical rationalism broke down because it is comprehensive, fideism is\npainful because it is not. Hence, rejecting both amounts to rejectingwhat they share:\nthe idea that rationality is proof. Consider, then, critical rationalism, the idea that\nrationality is disproof. Can we not show both options of it, qualified and\ncomprehensive, likewise painful? Can we apply the skeptical argument to\ncomprehensive critical rationalism and find it wanting, and then to apply the\nrationalist critique of fideism to qualified critical rationalism, and then be done with\nit altogether? Let me defeat this program.\nConsider first the application of classical rationalism to critical rationalism\n(qualified or comprehensive). This way critical rationalism fails of course. This has\nbeen showed repeatedly in the literature, yet it is trivial. Moreover, this is offered as\nfatal criticism, yet it is no criticism at all: there is no reason why critical rationalism\nshould submit to the rules of classical rationalism. Should it be applied to itself\ninstead? That classical rationalism should be proven by its own light is clear. But\ncritical rationalism should be held open to criticism, perhaps, or else it should be\nqualified. Here possibly Popper and Bartley disagreed. What is the reasoning here?\nCan we discuss this matter without begging the question?\nThe claim that logic is obligatory is inherent in the history of the debate over\nrationality. Hence, it is not contested that the aim of criticism is to refute its object.\nFrom the very start Popper stressed that he never adjudicated the matter of the\nsuccess of each piece of criticism, that all he said in general was no more than what\nlogic requires: if and when a piece of criticism is judged successful, then it is thereby\nalso judged as having refuted its object. To repeat, Popper offers as a solution to the\nproblem of rationality not a logical truth, but a conjecture, the novel theory that\ndisproof suffices for the advancement of knowledge in general and of science in\nparticular. How does he know that disproof suffices? He does not; it is his conjecture.\nQuery: is it rational to advocate this presupposition, this initial basic axiom? Can\nthere be a critical debate of it? If not, it seems fideist; if yes, it seems comprehensive.\nWhich is it?\nAssume that we must choose some initial basic axiom; how can the choice be\nrational? Given Popper's theory of rationality as openness to criticism, the answer to\nthis question is obvious: to the extent that it is criticizable and open to criticism, it is.\nDoes this apply to Popper's own choice? Should a critical rationalist be open-minded\nabout being open-minded? This is hard to say. Let us try to do so by splitting critical\nrationalism into two theses, one minor, one major, so that the question splits into two\nas well. The minor thesis is that criticism is binding. Is it? In other words, is logic\nbinding? The major thesis is that disproof suffices for intellectual progress. Is it? Till\nnow adherence to logic was taken for granted; nevertheless, possibly, comprehensive\ncritical rationalism requires an examination of our commitment to logic.\nAlready Plato asked, how binding is logic? In the end of his Phaedo,\ndescribing Socrates' last minutes, he ascribes to him the refusal to give up reason;\nnothing, Socrates seems to say, will sway him away from logic: he will never be a\nmysologist: even in his last hour he will gladly accept criticism. It is hard to say\nwhether this reading of the text is right, since the question is intricate. But Popper's\ntext seemed to me clear enough \u2500 until he declared Bartley's reading of it erroneous:\nI then began to doubt my reading of his text. For a lark, however, let me cling to my\nold reading of his text, as examining a view is more important than its authorship.\n(Besides, the first author of qualified critical rationalism is anyway Plato or Heinrich\nHeine.) To avoid all misconception of my motive, let me repeat: this discussion is no\ndefense of Popper or of Bartley, since I dissent from both.\nPlato's insistence on open-mindedness, his refusal to be open-minded about it,\nseems to identify rationality with logic. This is not clear, especially since formal\nlogic was invented later, and since it was not satisfactory till the twentieth century, if\never. So logic was open to criticism. Is it still? If yes, can its authority be revoked? In\nother words, can there be a critical debate on the rationality of logic, and if it is found\ndefective, can it be taken for granted? This depends on what we mean by the demand\nto reject a refuted version of it. If it is the demand to improve logic, then yes; if it is\nthe demand to jettison it, then no. Hence, in the broad sense logic is not given to\nrational deliberations, and so it is the initial axiom of rationality. Yet, in the narrow\nsense logic is very much given to rational deliberations, and this is expressed in the\nperennial efforts to improve it. (This seems to be the major thrust of the critique of\nthe view of logic as above criticism that we usually ascribe to Van Quine.)\nThis holds for all possible versions of the theory of rationality, since, to repeat,\ndiscussion of it was always conducted within logic. And then, Popper's claim that\nrationality is not comprehensive can be seen (not as a concession to fideism but) as\nmaking explicit a point that was traditionally taken for granted and that the modern\nhistory of logic makes its explicit statement desirable: the broad commitment to logic\ninvites efforts at its improvement in detail. Once this is noted, the discussion of\ncomprehensiveness has to be recast in a more precise manner. For example, the\nadvocates of fideism' commitment to their tradition is less irrational if it is only a\nbroad commitment, while being open-minded about any detail of it. (This is no small\ndifference, as it replaces the refusal to engage in intellectual traffic between different\ntraditions with a proposal to have it, at least up to a point, but the point is movable.)\nPopper has advocated this attitude to tradition in his classic if neglected 1947\n&#34;Towards a Rational Theory of Tradition&#34; [Popper, 1963].\nWith more due care, then, Bartley's comprehensiveness may read, his\ncommitment to logic is rational since he is open to its critical assessment. The same\nholds for Popper, of course. Where, then, is the difference between qualified and\ncomprehensive critical rationalism? Perhaps the difference lies in the disagreement\nabout the major thesis, the thesis that the engagement in critical debates suffices for\nthe advancement of learning. Since criticism involves logic, the discussion of the\nmajor thesis involves the minor one, but we need not go over this ground again.\nSuppose that the thesis that criticism suffices for progress is refuted, then. What will\nthis suggest to critical rationalists? Again, it seems, it will invite an improvement, not\na total overthrow. This seems to be the attitude advocated and practiced by both\nattitudes. So how do they differ?\nThis is not an idle thought. Critical rationalism was criticized both ways: once\n\u2500 by Feyerabend and myself \u2500 with the observation that at times the suspension of\ncriticism (at least for a lark) is wise (as Popper admitted citing Galileo to that effect)\nand once \u2500 by myself \u2500 with the observation that scholasticism was critical but not\nprogressive. The reason for this defect is clear: scholastic criticism was conducted\nwithin a given framework that was not given to criticism; this was done consciously,\non the ground of the view that debates have to be limited by some initial basic axio m,\nvery much in the fideist manner. Popper was aware of this: in his early work he\ndemanded that the most theory most given to criticism should be examined first, and\nhe later criticized the scholastic theory, which he called &#34;the myth of the framework&#34;.\nHe was thus unclear if not inconsistent. The way to overcome the inconsistency is to\nspeak of maximal criticism instead of criticism when wording the thesis of critical\nrationalism. Popper suggested that the demand for maximal openness to criticism\nwill eliminate, or at least sufficiently prevent, the use of ad hoc hypotheses, as there\nreduce the level of openness to criticism of hypotheses.\nExcept that this was criticized too \u2500 also by myself. Many theories in\ntechnology are very open to criticism yet are very much ad hoc; efforts to put them to\ntest are made repeatedly, as they are of great technological value. Yet they are not\ndeemed intellectually as interesting as the scarcely testable theories that are on the\nforefront of theoretical research. Since critical rationalism does not differentiate\nbetween pure and applied research, it demands improvement. This holds for Popper\nand for Bartley equally.\nSince qualified critical rationalism demands openness to criticism not only in\nthe abstract but also as exhibited in the possibility of a concrete criticism, in the high\nrisk of the theory in question, Bartley could ask Popper, how great should this risk be\nbefore it is deemed great enough? Popper had an answer to this question already in\n1935, but only as far as science is concerned: the risk is measured there by the\nlikelihood of an experiment that can be designed and performed to refute the theory\nin question; this likelihood can be measured by some extant alternative or by\ncommon sense. But Popper himself admitted in 1945 that weaker kinds of criticism\nare possible, in history and in philosophy, including ethics. How much should the\nrisk be a real one? (Significantly, Bartley took seriously the weak criticism that\npseudo-intellectual sects directed against the established commonwealth of learning.\nHe suggested [Bartley, 1990, 100] that since the academy is so very dogmatic, these\nfleeting intellectual clusters are where the action really is. This view is intriguing but\nalas not serious.) Nor is that all. Popper spent much of his effort arguing that\ncriticism is beneficial, which should be incontestable, and that the theory of\nrationality as the critical attitude does not suffer from the skeptical critique. Bartley\non his part spent much time arguing that since critical rationalism is not hit by the\nskeptic critique it can be held comprehensively. But they both argued prematurely,\noverlooking the critical examination of the claim that they perform the task for which\nthey were designed.\nThe question that the classical theory of rationality came to answer is, what\ntheory should be believed? Critical rationalists refuse to answer this question, as it\nprefers the diversity of opinions. Rather, it comes to exclude the theories that are not\nreasonable to believe, beginning with traditional local myths. The wish to promote\nthe progress of science is better than the wish to believe in current science. Proof\ndoes not do it; does disproof? No; critical rationalism never guaranteed success. Can\nit at least explain success? No; explanation amounts to guarantee: to say that A is\ncaused by B is to guarantee the presence of A in the presence of B. Critical\nrationalism guarantees not the success in providing conjectures and their criticism,\nbut that when these are present, progress obtains. How? The answer is what makes\ncritical rationalism so very intriguing: criticism is not the cause of intellectual\nprogress; it is intellectual progress. This, however, is a new conception of progress,\nand it can be challenged. We have not shed light this way on an important matter:\nwhy is the Popper-Bartley dispute important? In answer to this Bartley said,\nerroneously, because the tu-quoque argument is a serious challenge. This challenge\nmay signify at most for critical rationalism, not for science proper.\n4. Rationality as Partial and as Social\nWe see again that the discussion requires better presentation. Let us begin with\nrationality, whatever it is. Rationality as proof is an all-or-nothing affair; criticism is\npossibly more graded. Consider it a matter of degree. I. C. Jarvie and I have\nintroduced this idea decades ago. The measure of the degree of rationality, we\nsuggest, is not some abstract scale but depends on the available intellectual tools. It is\nclear, we said, that for one living in a preliterate society the most rational act and\nattitude will be much inferior to that available to one living in a society familiar with\nscience. This enters the social dimens ion into the debate, and so it really needs going\nover and, when necessary, recast. This is no small matter. Traditionally the options\navailable to social philosophy were individualism and collectivism. As collectivism\nnaturally distrusts individual reason as disruptive, it tends to be irrationalist.\nIndividualism then ruled the debate on rationality. And as individuals depend on\nsociety to this or that extent, though not wholly, their rationality should be cast in\nsocial terms and then viewed as partial.\nTo take a simple example, whereas traditional advocates of fideism discussed\nthe matter of rationality in an individualist framework, they could hardly answer the\nquestion, how should I choose my initial axioms? They did not have clear instances\nof initial axioms, and it looked as if infinitely many alternatives are available. Asking\nthe question in a social manner it becomes the question of the choice of a community,\nand there are a few communities to join; moreover, one cannot change communities\nevery week, and so, for merely technical reasons, one must live on one so as to\nacquire is basic tenets. It was stressed by Michael Polanyi, that when one joins a\ncommunity one scarcely knows what it has to offer, especially if the community in\nquestion is the scientific community, and that when one learns the initial basic\naxioms one may find that they are not given to simple articulation. He stressed,\nhowever, that one can belong to more than one community without fear of\ncontradiction. He did not elaborate. Another historical example should serve as\nevidence of the defect of the abstract discussion that Popper still participated in: the\nold scholastic tradition is not considered as rational as the new scientific tradition\n(even on the supposition that the old gave birth to the young). I skip the details here.\nAs long as science plays the role of a paradigm of rational activity, the\nindividual is most rational when joining the scientific community. Popper has\nsuggested that science is a social institution, one that encourages criticism. He also\nsuggested that parliamentary democracy is such a paradigm, and the same holds for\nthat paradigm. That there may be inconsistency between science and democracy, as\nwell as within each, is no reason for defection, as it may be a challenge for efforts to\nimprove. Popper said, the reason for these being paradigms of rationality is that\nrationality is the effort to improve through criticism.\nCan we rephrase the Popper-Bartley dispute within a social framework? All\ntheories of rationality recommend joining actively the life of science and of\ndemocracy. The view of rationality as improvable goes better with critical\nrationalism than with classical rationalism. Is here a significant difference between\nPopper and Bartley? Can we rephrase Bartley's philosophy socially? I do not know.\nThe critical attitude commends both a personal openness to criticism and an\ninstitutional setup that encourages criticism and is open to reform. The criticism of an\ninstitution, or of an institutionalized opinion, however, is not the same as the\ncriticism of an individual's opinion: the one is a personal matter, the other is social.\nValid criticism should always lead one to the search of alternatives, and reform is\naccepted not after criticism is voiced and endorsed but after a viable alternative is\nfound and tested in instituted manners. What this means for Popper is clear enough:\nboth democracy and science are open to reform. What does this mean for Bartley\nabove and beyond what it means to Popper I cannot see. Perhaps this means that\npossibly democracy and/or science will be criticized in a new manner that will lead\nto a proposal of a totally new regime and/or research protocol and Bartley will be\nwilling to test it. Whether this is so or not is hard to say: the discussion becomes too\nabstract here.\nBibliography\nAgassi, Joseph, 1981.

 u"Michael S. Myslobodsky, ed.,\nThe Mythomanias: The Nature of Deception and Self -deception.\nHillsdale NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, 1996, pp. 23-50.\nDeception: A View from the Rationalist Perspective\nBy Joseph Agassi,\nTel Aviv University and York University, Toro nto\nSelf- Deception in General\n&#34;A Liberal Decalogue&#34; suggests (Russell, 1967, pp. 60-61) not\nto envy people who live in a fool's paradise: It is a place only\nfor fools. This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's\nparadise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of\nopinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down,\nthat reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when\nall is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of\ntheir situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to\nget them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is\nlittle that can be done about it, except that the wise would still\nprefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic\nmore constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the\nreassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable\nalternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - -\nso that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to\nmobilize some appropriate action.\nAlternatively, fools may tell themselves that there is no risk.\nThis is self- deception, and the question is, why do people\ndeceive themselves and take risks? To take a concrete\nexample, people with weak hearts may avoid taking precautions\nand prefer to live like normal people and risk instant death\nfrom heart failure. This is possibly a rational choice. Yet some\nwho suffer from weak hearts pretend, even to themselves, that\nthey are normal. It is hard then to say whether they have\nchosen to live normally and take the risk. Perhaps they prefer\nto take precautions, and yet do not do so because they are\nunable to look the risk straight in the face.\nMore sophisticated ways of living in a fool's paradise are\nknown. One may live there knowingly. One may feel that one\ndoes not share the reassuring received opinion, yet pretend\nthat one does. This is what Russell warned against: Anyone\nwho knowingly chooses to live in a fool's paradise is still a fool.\nAnyone who thinks that awareness of one's living in a fool's\nparadise immunizes one to its dangers is a fool. This is self-\ndeception about one's ability to cope with deceit. Many\nphilosophers have noted that people who habitually deceive\nfinally fall for their own deceptions. This is the well-known\nphenomenon that confidence artists appeal to the willingness of\ntheir victims to deceive both themselves and others in one and\nthe same act: The victims are encouraged to deceive\nthemselves into thinking that they deceive only others while\nignoring their own greed and the immorality of the way they\nchoose to satisfy it. To this Russell added that the same holds\ntrue for all self -deception: Those who think they can live in\nsituation of self-deception without deceiving themselves finally\nfall for their own self-deception. The seemingly wise deceive\nthemselves that they only pretend that they endorse the\nreassuring hypothesis: They do not know the cost of the\npretense, which is the neglect of thinking out the viable\nalternatives.\nThe reason one endorses the reassuring hypothesis despite\nattempts to immunize oneself is complex. It is in part\nintellectual: One does not invest in the examination of\nalternative hypotheses. It is in part social: One cannot discuss\nalternative possibilities when one pretends to the world that\none is committed to the reassuring hypothesis. It is in part\npsychological: One is ambivalent about matters, and one\nreassures oneself that one does not need the reassurance.\nThe case of self- deception, in brief, is complex. It involves\nerror, impatience in thinking out detailed matters,\nunwillingness to examine each and every obvious option, and\nalso deception proper. Yet clearly something is missing here: It\nis fear and obsession. As Freud was first to notice, self-\ndeception usually rests on the stubborn reluctance to consider\nalternatives when these are suggested by others.\nNot all cases of self -deception, however, are cases of life in\nfool's paradise. This phenomenon is usually associated with the\nself-deception that involves whole social groups. The social\ncase is more complex than the personal case. The personal\ncase of self -deception is puzzling because its victims refuse to\nconsider corrections suggested by their environment. The case\nof the fool's paradise that is group self -deception, usually\nnational, is different and more complex: A whole society\ndeclares a certain option not open to public discussion. Its\ngiven rationale is that it is dangerous to discuss different\noptions -- because it will help other people or discourage our\npeople. Indeed, it is very similar to the case of the confidence\nartist: The group (national) leadership suggests that, although\nour case may be shaky, we may be able to succeed if it will be\nnevertheless accepted, and for this it should be presented with\nfull confidence. All that is missing from the picture to complete\nit are two true observations. First, many political leaders are\nconfidence tricksters, and they see themselves as such.\nSecond, confidence tricksters make a profession of deceiving\nthemselves that they deceive only others. In principle, the n,\nthe difference between the two cases -- the private and the\npublic -- is only technical: Both are cases of reluctance -- of\nnot allowing oneself to examine views that deserve to be\nexamined, where an excuse for this reluctance is left\nunexamined as well . The two cases differ as to the excuse\noffered for the reluctance. To make the difference purely\ntechnical, what is needed is to observe, as is explained in detail\nhere, that any effort to present a case authoritatively -- be it\npersonal, social, politica l, or intellectual -- is in itself nothing\nshort of self-deception.\nIn summary, when one deceives oneself, one does not know the\ncost of the self -deception, and it is usually this that makes the\nerror significant. In other words, however irrational any c ase of\nself-deception looks, when one unpacks it, one finds it not very\nproblematic. The inability to see this rests on a difficulty that\nenters the picture with the introduction of a theory of\nrationality. Two important theories of rationality are found in\nWestern philosophy. The earlier of the tow is the more\nimportant. It was known as the rationlist theory, and now it is\nknown as classical rationalism. It identifies rational action with\none based on rational belief and rational belief as that which\nrests on proof of sorts (Agassi, 1986a; Agassi &amp; Jarvie, 1987,\nChapter 16.) The other important theory is romanticism: It\nidentifies rational action with one based on strong intuition:\nOne acts rationally when one is true to one's inner self, when\none listens to the right inner voice. This theory, be it true or\nfalse, is not given to rational discussion for the following\nreason. There is only one argument against it: By listening to\none's inner voice, one can make tragic decisions. The followers\nof the romantic theory of rationality are not dissuaded by this\nargument for reasons that are good or bad. Whatever is the\ntruth of the matter, the followers of the romantic theory are\nunshakable. Hence, there is no point in pursuing this discussion\nunless and until someone comes up with a new suggestion (for\ndetails see Agassi, 1982).\nThe rest of this chapter is devoted to a discussion of the\nclassical theory of rationality and of its implications for the\ncase of self -deception. At the end, a new avenue for the theory\no f rationality is highlighted. The newer theory of rationality is\nmore commonsensical, as it takes rationality to be a matter of\ntrial and error. Thus, it permits the discussion to proceed along\nthe lines suggested here.\nRationality and the Social Order\nThe prevalence of self -deception is part of folk knowledge; it is\nthe target of a rich folk literature, and of more sophisticated\nliterature as well. It has not puzzled people, however, until the\nadvent of modern times. The reason is not far to seek: The\nphenomenon began to puzzle people when it conflicted with\nreceived opinion and/or when it constituted a challenge that\nwas surprisingly hard to meet. The surprising difficulty\npresented by a challenge testifies to the presence of a theory\nin the light of which it should be easily met. The theory that\nhuman beings are rational is the source of the trouble:\nObviously, self -deception is not rational.\nAs long as the received opinion was that human beings are\nfoolish, or unreasonable, it was expected that they sho uld\nbehave erratically, deceive themselves, and so on. Clearly, this\ntraditionally received opinion was an unavoidable corollary to\nthe traditionally received religious doctrines of the Western\nworld prior to modern times: The wages of sin are slight and\nmomentary and the cost of sin is eternal damnation; Hence\nnothing is more rational than to behave properly. Yet people\nwill sin (&#34;the flesh is weak&#34;). The prevalence of sin was taken\nby all the traditionally received religious doctrines of the\nWestern world prior to modern times as conclusive evidence of\nhuman irrationality.\nThe situation was taken quite differently by most of the modern\nrationalistic philosophers, the classical rationalists: They\nconsidered the prevalence of sin to be evidence that sinners\nsimply do not believe in eternal damnation. They reasoned\nthus: Rational people act in accord with their beliefs; people do\nnot act in accord with the belief that their actions will lead to\neternal damnation; hence, clearly, they do not believe in\neternal damnation. Moreover, the classical rationalists taught\nthat it is important to hold the right beliefs. To this end, beliefs\nshould be adopted rationally, and then all will be as well as can\nbe expected. Self-deception, however, does not fit the classical\nrationalist prescription: Classical rationalists always viewed it\nas the willful deviation from rational belief. Its prevalence,\nthen, is, or seems to be, a refutation of their theory of rational\nbelief. Hence its centrality for their theory of rationality -- for\nthe theory of rationality presented in the classical rationalist\ntradition (Agassi, 1977, 1991).\nThis last point deserves a slight elaboration. Practically all\nWestern religious traditions and practically all folk wisdom\nconstantly preach the restraint of natural human appetites on\nthe ground of the (false) observation that selfish conduct\nobviously undermines social stability. The classical (Western)\ntradition of rationalist philosophy disagreed with this teaching\nand rejected this observation (as obviously the very opposite of\nthe truth). It declared any desirable restraint better achieved\nby reasonable, self- reliant individuals than by those frightened\nby hell fire and brimstone. Classical rationalists preferred, on\nthe whole, not to prescribe restraint. They did not deny that\nsome restraint is reasonable. Yet they considered particularly\nerroneous the demand to avoid greed and selfishness. The\nreasonable, self- reliant individual, they taught, will practice the\nnecessary self- restraint anyway. The end of rational conduct is\nalways selfish, as action comes to satisfy the natural appetites\nof actors. Hence, the best way to act, the best way to achieve\none's end, is to behave intelligently - - to act as a reasonable\nself- reliant individual (Agassi, 1 986b).\nIn brief, the classical (Western) tradition of rationalist\nphilosophy rejected as too strict the preaching of (Western)\nreligious traditions and folk wisdom for the restraint of natural\nhuman appetites. Its preached reasonable self- reliance, on the\nopposite view that reasonable, self- reliant individuals are\nbetter able to judge how strict their conduct should be.\nRational action is best guided by thought; Hence, the problem\nof rationality is less a question of the choice of a mode of\nconduct and more the question of the choice of the right belief\nto endorse. The problem then can be limited, at least initially,\nto rational belief.\nThe 17th- and 18th-century rationalist philosophers were\nliberals. They learned to argue against the traditional religio u s\nrequirement for strictness, which was based on the observation\nthat the unintended social consequences of selfish action are\nsocially undesirable. The liberal philosophers suggested, on the\ncontrary, that some social conditions ensure that the\nunintend ed social consequences of selfish action are socially\ndesirable. Under such conditions, then, following natural\nappetites, selfish actions will (unintentionally) support social\nstability rather than undermine it. If so, instead of preaching to\ncurb natural human appetites by the threat of hell fire and\nbrimstone and eternal damnation, it is wiser to create\nconditions that will make selfish conduct socially beneficial:\nThe readiness to act selfishly is more reliable than the\nreadiness to curb selfish motives merely out of fear (Gellner,\n1992, 1995, p. 8.)\nInitially, in the 17th and 18th centuries, the theory of\nrationality was prescriptive rather than descriptive. It became\ndescriptive in the 19th and 20th centuries, with the advent of\nmodern social science . It was recognized then that it is well\nworth investigating the facts of the matter, to observe what\nactions some extant ideas bespeak, and how. This created a\nneed to distinguish explicitly between the two kinds of\nrationality: (a) the intellectual ratio nal choice, the choice of\nbeliefs or of opinions to endorse; (b) the practical rational\nchoice, the choice of the right conduct. This distinction is\nbriefly denoted as the choice between rational thought and\nrational action, or that between thought and action. The need\nto make this distinction explicit was first presented in modern\nsociology. It usually goes by the name of Max Weber, one of\nthe acknowledged fathers of that field, who made his studies at\nthe end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th cent uries.\nNow the classical rationalist assumption is that action is guided\nby thought, and rationally this is done as best as possible.\nHence, the problem of rationality can be limited, at least\ninitially, to the problem of rational thought: What opinions\nshould one endorse? What is rational to believe in? What\ncriterion of choice of a belief should one endorse? The best\nsolutions to these questions, the classical rationalists taught,\nwill ensure the best solutions to all problems.\nRationality and Self- reliance\nQuestion: why did the classical rationalists find it so important\nto insist that, by the classical rationalist recipe, all is as well as\ncan be expected?\nAnswer: Because throughout the history of classical\nrationalism, its adherents have opposed the re ligious doctrine\nthat humans are evil and replaced it with the classical\nrationalist gospel of self- reliance as the road to salvation\n(Agassi, 1977).\nQuestion: If all is as well as can be expected, why is the world\nstill so frustrating, why are people so d isappointing as they\nare?\nAnswer: Because, says the classical rationalist, people are still\nnot self- reliant.\nQuestion: Why are people not self -reliant? What will make them\nso?\nAnswer: People are not self- reliant, says the classical\nrationalist, because they are captives of the [religious]\ndoctrines which they are taught, which makes them rely on\ntheir teachers. Only giving up these doctrines will enable\npeople to become self-reliant. After the act of giving up\nreceived opinions, beliefs will be as rational as can be expected\n(for more details see Agassi, 1991). The world may still not be\nperfect even when people will be as rational as possible, but it\nwill be as perfect as possible. This is the classical theory of\nrationality: Rational conduct will bring about the best of all\npossible worlds, says the classical rationalist, particularly\nbecause it will advance scientific research, and thus increase\nself-knowledge and self -reliance.\nIt was in this way that self -deception was integrated into the\nbroader system of the modern or classical rationalist\nmovement, or of the Enlightenment movement, or the moderns.\nSelf- deception, they taught, is irrational, and irrationality is\ndue to the absence of self- reliance, and this absence is due to\nlies with which one is ra ised. Members of this movement were\nhardly ever explicit about religion. Few of those who were\nreligiously skeptic dared hint at that fact. It only became\npermissible to refuse to assume the existence of God in the\nearly 19th century, after the demise of t hat movement, and\neven then there was no attack on established religion until the\nmid -19th century. Nevertheless, this much is clear: The\nundercurrent of the gospel of Enlightenment was that of self-\nreliance; the educational system was blamed for teaching ideas\nthat impede it. The education system was, of course, run and\ncarefully monitored largely by the religious establishment. In\nthe civilized world, this monopoly was broken by the French\nand American Revolutions, yet the monitoring of it by the\nreligious establishment still goes on there to this day. However,\nfew will blame the religious establishment for the widespread of\nirrationality.\nThe situation merits careful analysis. The basic classical\nrationalist tenet is this: Self -reliance is the reliance on reason;\ntherefore it is the same as rationality. It follows from this that\nself- reliance, or rationality, is the best guide to life. There is\nno substitute for thinking: Regardless of whether one is\nreligious, it was suggested, one should not rely on any church\nor leader. Some modern rationalist philosophers preached and\nstill preach religious self- reliance, of course (&#34;God helps those\nwho help themselves&#34;). Yet it was this idea that undermined\nthe authority of established churches and leaderships,\nregardless of whether and to what extent this authority was\nhostile to self -reliance.\nThe question then is, what is rationality? It was treated in a\nstandard way within the classical rationalist tradition, and its\ncurrent formulation is as follows. The question is first split into\ntwo: What is rational action? What is rational belief? The\nclassical rationalist tradition took it for granted that people\nalways act in accord with their beliefs; Otherwise they are\ncoerced by others, by the laws of the land, or by the laws of\nnature, and so they do not act freely, and so they do not really\nact. This is the distinction between action and behavior that\nentered the literature. (Behaviorism, accordingly, is the view\nthat people never act in this sense of the word -- tha t they are\nalways coerced to move as they do by the combination of the\ngeneral laws of nature and specific circumstances. The standard\nclassical rationalist view rejects this doctrine and takes for\ngranted as a fact the repeated observation that people do act.)\nAssuming, then, that people act, it follows that they act\nrationally. It then follows that if their beliefs are rationally\nheld, then their conduct is as good as can be reasonably\nexpected. This seems reasonable, and even commonsense. It is\ncommonsense, of course, only on the supposition that humans\nare naturally rational and self- reliant, that irrational conduct is\ndue to childhood indoctrination in unreasonable beliefs, and\nthat this indoctrination can be overcome for the asking. This\nmeans that peo ple are rational unless they are deceived. Why,\nthen, do people insist on being deceived? Why are people\ngullible? Classical rationalism offers no answer. This is the big\ngap in the classical rationalism of the Enlightenment\nmovement. This doctrine is still very popular, and so the gap is\nstill conspicuous.\nThus, the prevalence of self- deception is the major refutation\nto the doctrine of natural human rationality which is at the root\nof the doctrine of the Enlightenment movement. Moreover, all\ndeception is due to the fact that some of it is successful, and\nsuccessful deception is possible only because many people\nallow themselves to be deceived. Why do they? Because they\ndeceive themselves about other people's credibility. Admittedly,\nsince rational opinio n is at times erroneous, one may be\ndeceived without self-deception. Yet, since reason is the best\nguide, if the rationalist philosophy is true, it will prevent\nconstant systematic error. Systematic error is the result of\ninsistence on it, of the mistrust of reason, and so it is due to\nself-deception. Even the trust in the teaching and\nindoctrination during childhood is a form of self -deception. It is\npossible and rationally obligatory to give it up and be set free.\nYet people often cling to their education. They deceive\nthemselves to trust it. The question that classical rationalism\nhas to answer is, why then do people allow others to deceive\nthem systematically? According to classical rationalism, what\nprevents bridging the gulf between the best, which is the life of\nreason, and the real, which is the practice of systematic error,\nis self- deception alone. This phenomenon deserves special\nattention: It is any systematic error that cannot be viewed as\nanything other than self- deception: All effort to correct it are\nmet with unintelligent excuses.\nError and Sin\nThe ethics of the Enlightenment movement, of the modern\nphilosophy of life, is simple: &#34;Reason is and ought only to be,\nthe slave of the passions&#34;, as David Hume has aptly put it\n(Hume, 1980, Bk. 2, Pt. 3, Sec. 3). On this view, self- interest\nis the only right motive force for action, provided it employs\nreason to the full, which, of course, is eminently reasonable.\nHence, all sin is violation of self -interest, and so, at bottom, all\nsin is error. This is the doctrine of enlightened self-interest. It\nis scarcely new. In antiquity it was known as the Socratic\ndoctrine of eudaimony ('eu' is good and 'daimon' is spirit; the\nname refers to the story, narrated in Plato's The Apology of\nSocrates -- Socrates explains that he is the wisest by reporting\nthat he has a good Fairy Godmother who prevents him from\ndoing what he does not want to do, which is not good for him).\nThis doctrine is particularly hard to defend, since experience is\nmore in accord with the opposite doctrine, according to which\nhumans are both wicked and self-destructive. Thus, the moral\ndoctrine of classical rationalism appears to be empirically\nrefuted.\nThe rejoinder to this criticism comes in two steps. The first\nmove is to reduce all self -des truction to self -deception -- on\nthe supposition that as self -destruction hurts oneself, it is\nnever desirable and so it is never reasonably desired. (It is\nunnatural.) The second move is to reduce wickedness to self -\ndestruction. The way to effect this last reduction is to show\nthat the wicked are sawing the branch on which they sit. This is\nshown by the claim that, as their need for friends requires they\nshould be benevolent not wicked. This is unsatisfactory, as it\nmay work for friends, perhaps even for p otential friends too,\nbut not ever for enemies. It looks eminently reasonable to be\nvicious to them. Then different arguments are marshaled. An\nappeal is made to providence: It is in one's best interest to be\non good terms with divine powers. This, too, is unsatisfactory,\nas it is an appeal to the wishes of the divine, not to those of a\nself- reliant actor. The holders of the monopoly on divine\npowers always oppose self- reliance. An appeal may then be\nmade to one's need for peace of mind, and hence for peace\nwith one's conscience (he conclusion of Hume, 1980, explains\nmartyrdom this way). This, too, is unsatisfactory: Conscience is\nbased on religion, and the exercise of eudaimony was initially\nintended to do away with it, and for good reasons: Clearly, it is\nnot conscience, but the sense of guilt, that disturbs the peace\nof mind. This sense of guilt is forcibly established by religious\neducation to undermine self- reliance. All advocates of self-\nreliance recommend that the sense of guilt be eradicated\n(Kaufmann , 1973; Agassi &amp; Agassi, 1985).\nIt is still possible to defend the doctrine of eudaimony, or\nenlightened self- interest: Self -destructive action is prevented\nby the sufficiently clear understanding of its consequences. The\nstandard contemporary example is smoking, but any bad habit\nwill do. The victims of a bad habit know that their conduct is\nnot in their self- interest, but only in a vague manner: They\noften refuse to see it clearly until their physician convinces\nthem that they are killing themselves. Then many of these\npeople find themselves freed of their bad habit with no effort at\nall. Hence, the intensified energy and sense of guilt invested in\nefforts to stop a bad habit are forms of self -deception: What is\nneeded is not effort nor strong will, but clear understanding of\nthe harm it causes, say the sages of the Enlightenment.\nAs it happens, all this is neither here nor there. Whatever the\nrule is for right behavior, it is clear that self-deception is not\nthe right mode of conduct, yet it is prevale nt. Even the\nassumption that all wickedness is due to self-deception does\nnot help vindicate humanity very much, since self- deception is\nevidently wicked: The pure at heart will hardly fall for it.\n(Others are guilty of the sin of pride.) Hence, regardless of\nwhether one should be as fully self- reliant as possible, and\nwhether the canons of right conduct are those of enlightened\nself- interest, self-deception is both erroneous and sinful, yet it\nis regularly practiced. Why? In particular, is it the sin of it that\nbrings about the error, or is it the other way around?\nBefore we proceed, we may wish to know, what does it matter?\nImperfection is a familiar fact, as are both wickedness and\nstupidity. Why does the old party insist that all impropriety is\nsin, an d why does the new party insist that all sin is error? Why\nnot lump them together, or say that impropriety and\nmisconduct are at times due to error and at other times due to\nsin (and often due to both)? After all, criminal law says exactly\nthis: Criminal c ourts are often called to adjudicate and decide\nabout the reason for some misdeed - - is it due to sin or to\nerror? Moreover, such courts also distinguish between\npermissible and impermissible error. (This is the root difference\nbetween murder, premeditated or not, and involuntary\nmanslaughter or accidental killing.) Why insist on reducing\nerror to sin or the other way around?\nThe answer is this: Suppose that behind every sin lurks some\nerror. The way to reduce sin is then not by preaching, but by\nenlighte ning. This is the explanation that historically stood\nbehind the Enlightenment movement's optimistic view of\nhumanity: Sinfulness is allegedly a part of human nature,\nwhereas ignorance certainly is not. But this is questionable:\nJust as one may say that be hind every sin is error, one may\nalso say that behind every error is sin. Ignorance leads to\nexcusable error only, whereas the error of people's ways are\ndeviations from the straight and narrow. Established religion\ncomes to prevent sin, and it teaches the true doctrine, but\npeople who are wicked will not listen. Thus, according to all\nestablishments that issue rules of proper conduct, self-reliance\nis the cardinal sin. (Hence, science can have no such\nestablishment! This is conspicuously false, yet in the Age of\nReason, in the time when classical rationalism flourished, it\nwas much more reasonable than it is today to assume that\nscience has no establishment whatsoever.) Here, again, we\nmeet the source of the disagreement: It is this question --\nwhat is bett er to rely on, individual self- reliance or traditional\nwisdom?\nThis does not solve the problem at all. The fact remains that\nboth morality and science are cultivated. Why try to eliminate\none of these? The answer is that one depends on the other:\nWisdom, says established religion, begins with the purity of\nheart (&#34;the beginning of wisdom is the fear of God&#34;); ethics,\nretort the enlightened, begins with the intelligent employment\nof reason. Does this dispute matter? Should it not be ignored\nand both morality and reason be employed?\nAll this will still not do. This discussion is stuck with the\nproblematic phenomenon of self -deception; it is admittedly\nboth stupid and wicked; It is better eradicated, but no one\nknows how. Even the combined use of both expla ining and\npreaching does not overcome it, and so there is a genuine need\nto learn more about it so as to cure it. The two common\ntheories identify it as a sin as well as an error, yet they differ\nas to which one is the source of the other. Which is it then? In\nthe hope of finding a better cure, a better understanding of\nself-deception may be sought. In this search, attempts may be\nmade to criticize both theories.\nBacon's Doctrine of Prejudice\nThe present discussion has got into a loop as sin and error are\nreducible to one another: Even if all error/sin is sin/error, it\nseems that the very disposition to err/sin lies in our\nmoral/intellectual imperfection. All humans are disposed to\nboth sin and error, and it is hard to decide which of the two\ndispositions lies deeper. Moreover, as this discussion concerns\nself-deception, it is important to note possibly self -deception is\ninexplicable even were it known if error is the cause of sin or\nvice versa. The curious historical fact is that the presentation\nof the problem was first forcefully made by Sir Francis Bacon,\naround the year 1600. He solved it not by any attempt to\nchoose between blaming sin for error and blaming error for sin\nbut by blaming self-deception for both. He was not concerned\nwith the question, which comes first, sin or error? He was not\nconcerned with social and political philosophy. He had a\ntremendous vision: A great scientific revolution is in the offing,\nand it will bring about a great technological revolution. He was\nconvinced that most social and political problems would be\nsolved by the technological revolution. Until then, he\nrecommended, a conservative attitude to politics should\nprevail.\nAs Bacon was convinced that technology would be\nrevolutionized by the development of scientific knowle dge\nproper, his sole concern in most of his writings was to help the\nadvancement of learning (for a detailed discussion of all this,\nsee Agassi, 1988b). Bacon took for granted the ancient doctrine\nof how enlightenment comes about: The pure mind is prepared\nto perceive the truth in an intuitive experience of sorts. This\ndoctrine is generally known all over the world as mysticism\n(see Agassi, 1981b, Chapter 23). There is much confusion here:\nThe mystics proper do not claim that their knowledge is given\nto cle ar articulation, yet the Platonic and Aristotelian theories\nof learning do. Hence, these theories are not quite mystical;\nthe neo -Platonic or cabalistic doctrines are mystical. The\ncentral question that this raises is, how is the mind purified? It\nengaged Bacon as it engaged many others before and after\nhim. (Different mystics have offered different rituals for this\npurpose.) Everybody agrees, of course, that, to that end, the\nmind has to be of a righteous man -- free of error. The\nquestion remains, how is the mind of cleansed of its errors?\nBoth Plato and Aristotle recommended critical debate as the\nmeans to that end. (Aristotle called this method 'epagoge', and\nthis word was translated into 'induction'.) It is the method of\nquestioning that ends up with de finitions, said Aristotle, as\ninvented by the Pythagoreans and perfected by Socrates and\nPlato. Definitions are the foundations of science, Aristotle\nadded, and they constitute the source of all true knowledge.\nBacon agreed about all of this except for the ancient view of\nthe efficacy of critical debate.\nCritical debates, said Bacon, have gone on in universities for\ncenturies, yet to no avail: Each party sticks to its guns. The\nreason is simple: One can always ignore criticism, or dismiss it\nwith a wittic ism (&#34;this is an exception that proves the rule&#34;),\nor, if one is obliged to take account of it, one can make a new\nsubtle distinction, to make a small exception, or otherwise\nbelittle the worth of an argument.\nThis raises two central questions. First, is it always possible to\nbelittle criticism? Second, why should one do that? The answer\nto the first question is in the affirmative. It is a powerful part\nof logic, known today as the Duhem-Quine thesis. Exceptions\ncan always be classified in a different category. (To take a\ncommon example, the prejudiced who recommend the\ndiscrimination of any sort of people may admit that an instance\nof the sort in question is unjust; they will then place these\ncounterinstances in a separate class and cling to their prejudic e\nagainst the remaining members of the discriminated sort. For\nmore details about the Duhem-Quine thesis see Agassi, 1994.)\nThere are different attitudes to criticism. Duhem said science\nmust accept criticism only in small doses so as to maintain its\nco ntinuity. Why should science do that? Duhem did not explain,\nbut the truth is that he was defending the same medieval\nmethod that Bacon was attacking because he greatly respected\nthe same medieval thinkers Bacon despised. Bacon declared\nthem enemies of pro gress; Duhem declared their contributions\nessential to the history of science. Bacon denied the very\nexistence of mediaeval science; Duhem was its first great\nhistorian. More important, Bacon agreed with the ancient\nrevered philosophers that total scientif ic knowledge of the\nwhole universe is possible; Duhem did not. Bacon declared the\nneed for one and only one scientific revolution -- the one that\neradicates all prejudice and all error; Duhem advocated\ncontinuity and denied the possibility of scientific re volutions.\nBacon envisaged a tremendous explosion of science; Duhem\ntaught that science proceeds in small steps. Bacon ignored\nmathematics altogether and recommended for the mind free of\nprejudice to collect as many and diverse observations of simple\nfacts as possible, and to proceed slowly and carefully towards\nthe goal of total scientific knowledge; Duhem saw this as naive\nand insisted on the need to develop the mathematical\napparatus that is essential for scientific knowledge and fitting\nthe facts within it.\nHow is one to judge between these views? Probably most\npeople will reject both, at least because at least two scientific\nrevolutions have occurred, contrary to both. Bacon was too\nradical in his demand to clean the slate with no theory left and\nDuhe m was too conservative in his claim that science suffers no\nrevolution as each stage of it depends on a previous stage\n(Agassi, 1957, 1963, 1981b. See also the biography of Duhem,\nJaki, 1984).\nBacon was a Utopian visionary in the style of his time -- the\nearly 17th century. He based his vision on a new idea: He\nassumed that the rejection of all preconceived opinions and the\naccumulation of a vast collection of items of factual information\nwill lead rapidly to the full growth of theoretical science.\nFurthe r, he was deeply convinced that this growth will bring\nsalvation, and that salvation is around the corner because\neveryone is naturally disposed to contribute to the growth of\nknowledge (Bacon, 1994, Bk. I, Aphorisms 15 -18). Why, then,\nis salvation not here already? Because there is a small obstacle\nto it: The sins of laziness and pride. People offer conjectures\ninstead of working hard in the search for the truth, and then\nthey refuse to admit criticism as it puts them to shame. Thus,\nthe demand for the purity of mind includes the demand for\ndevotion and humility, caution and resistance to the temptation\nto conjecture. Once one has made a conjecture, one sees the\nworld as conforming to it, is then bound to endorse it as true,\nand is then trapped in it: It be comes a fixed feature of one's\nintellectual makeup. (This is corroborated by contemporary\ncognitive theory: One who endorses the theory that all is x, say\ncognitive psychologists, sees x everywhere; x can be atoms,\nlife, sex, selfishness, or anything else.)\nPrejudging matters instead of letting facts speak for\nthemselves, Bacon explained, is the acceptance of a bribe. His\nexplanation is subtle, and reminds one of what the Bible says\nof it (Exodus, 23:8): Bribery blinds the wise. That is, one says\nto onese lf that one is wise enough not to be blinded by the\nbribe, but to no avail. The very bribe, argued Bacon, is what\nblinds one to the truth, as it is the flattery to oneself. It is only\nself-deception that stands between humanity and salvation\nthrough science. People flatter themselves that they are\ncleverer and more knowledgeable than they are, thus getting\nblind to criticism. Moreover, the psychology of perception as\nfirst offered by Bacon, and as still taught today, suggests that\nnothing can be done about it. To become a good researcher,\nsaid Bacon, one must humbly admit ignorance, and relinquish\nall the preconceived notions that one happens to have; only\nthen, he said, will one qualify to seek knowledge, and even\nthen this holds as long as one does not pro nounce opinions.\nBacon's idea is generally rejected nowadays. It is generally\nagreed that people cannot live with empty heads. (Only some\ndevotees of popular cheap versions of Oriental mysticism\nendorse the false view that some techniques empty the head of\nall ideas.)\nThe observation that theory blinds one to facts that offer\ncriticism of it is a central part of contemporary psychology of\nperception and cognition. It often goes today by the name of\nthe 20th -century psychologist Leon Festinger. This observ ation\nhas led some thinkers, such as Giordano Bruno and Galileo\nGalilei of the 16th and 17th century, to the obvious conclusion\nthat such observations spuriously validate the theories that\ninvoke them. Bacon agreed but claimed that a theory can be\nproperly validated -- when it is rooted in unbiased\nobservations: As long as theory precedes observation, he said,\nits validation by facts is assured for all those who propound it\nand for no other; only if it emerges by itself out of many and\ndiverse observations, he assured his reader, is the result truly\nassured and will convince all. Hence, proper observation begins\nwith the cleaning of the observer's mind, and therefore\nobservers must be humble and attend to small facts, not aspire\nto be the proud originators o f great philosophical systems.\nWhy is the sin of pride so special in the scheme of things? Why\nare all sins to be viewed as errors, yet pride the sin at the root\nof error? Bacon answered that pride too is but error; of course\nit is a form of self -deception. It is the error that is the source\nof all errors, as it inhibits the natural disposition to learn the\ntruth; it perverts the natural order of things by placing theory\nprior to observation, like building a house beginning from the\nroof.\nBacon stressed that the matter is subtle. There was no known\nreason to forbid the making of conjectures before he discovered\nthat conjecture perverts the mind so that it is essential to\nrelinquish all preconceived notions before one can contribute to\nthe advancement of learning. Because the natural disposition to\ndevelop science is stronger than the disposition to make\nconjectures, Antiquity had knowledge and no reason to advance\nany conjecture. Then conjectures were advanced, especially\nthose of Aristotle, and they were wicked. Once knowledge was\nperverted, it could not be restored without Bacon's new cure --\nhis prescription of cleaning the slate and proceeding with\ncaution. Naturally until then self -deception was the rule.\nAccordingly, Bacon called his philosophy &#34;The Great\nInstauration&#34;, meaning the return to the golden age of\nAntiquity.\nA Short History of Self- Deception\nSelf- deception, to repeat, is ubiquitous, as is the folk literature\nabout it. Also, folk literature presents self -deception as self-\nflattery. This is a point that Bacon's doctrine makes central.\nBacon's proposal of a remedy had an old component and a new\none. The old component is the following advice: Do not be\ngullible, trust no one but the facts and your own reason. The\nnew component is; Discard all earlier opinions and start afresh.\nThis is Baconian radicalism, and this is what characterizes\nmodern, classical rationalist philosophy. Its most specific\ncharacteristic is its being Crusonian, as Popper and Gellner\nhave called it (Popper, 1945, vol. 2, pp. 219-20, 215; Gellner,\n1995, p. 7; see also Agassi, 1981b, pp. 477-85, 488). As\nDescartes found out, after cleaning one's slate and before\ndeveloping one's own philosophy, one is utterly alone. In the\n19th century Descartes' philosophy and his venture, the\nBaconian venture of starting afresh, were not as popular as in\nearlier centuries. One of its opponents was Kierkegaard (1985,\nPreface), who nevertheless admired Descartes for having the\ncourage needed for this venture. As this venture was deemed\ncentral to modern, classical rationalism, understandably,\nrejecting it led many, Kierkegaard included, to reject\nrationalism itself.\nThe reason that self -deception is the single obstacle, and such\na formidable one at that, is simple. Almost any obstacles that\nmay lie on the way of a self- reliant individual may be handled\nin the best manner available. The only insurmountable obstacle\nto self -reliance is self -deception, since its victims are unaware\nof its very presence. Classical rationalists deemed the Baconian\nventure of cleaning the slate indispensable because it is easy to\ndeceive oneself: As long as one holds to any opinion, to any\nopinion whatsoever, one is too well disposed toward it. Hence,\nthose who rejected Bacon's radicalism were disposed to the\nview that self -deception is unavoidable. After Bacon had\ngranted prominence and significance to the disposition for self -\ndeception as the chief obstacle to the advancement of learning,\nand so to advancement in general, it became clear that the\ndisposition to be rational depends on the single condition that\nself-deception be avoided. The irrationalists then centered, as\nthey still do, on this question: Can this single condition ever be\nmet? Irrationalism is the correct denial of the possibility of\navoiding all self- deception and the erroneous conclusion that it\nis better to rely on tradition, the leadership or one's gut -\nfeelings than on oneself.\n(Bacon's radicalism is not new: It is cabalistic in origin. Why\ndid the performance of the cabalistic ritual fail to bring\nsalvation? Because there is a catch here: To be valid, the ritual\nshould be perform by a deserving individual, and that individual\nmust be humble. But it is hard to be humble when one brings\nsalvation to the world. Why do people end up in hell if they\nmay repent even at the gates of hell? Because the wicked are\nhaughty, and, at the gate of hell, they deceive themselves that\nthey are there not deservedly, but out of good will - - out of the\nwill to save its inmates.)\nThe advocacy of self-reliance look as if it were identical to the\nadvocacy of rationality, and either looks as if it were identical\nto the advocacy of the avoidance of self- deception. The\nopposite of self-reliance is the reliance on others, who are not\nreliable, since there is nothing to rely o n except one's own\nreason. Hence, the reliance on others is being deceived and all\ndeception is self -deception at heart. According to Bacon, the\ntransition from reliance on others to self -reliance takes effort,\ncourage, and much good will. This is particularly so because,\nwe remember, according to Bacon, self -reliance begins with the\ncleaning of one's slate -- with starting afresh. This, as\nKierkegaard stressed, is rather frightening. It also leaves too\nmany questions unanswered, such as, what should one do in\nmatters pertaining to one's means of livelihood and of one's\nreligion? These questions were hardly ever dealt with.\nDescartes reported that he would not embark on the project of\ncleaning his slate before he had answered them to his own\nsatisfaction. To day, almost all students of this matter agree\nthat these questions were hardly ever dealt with, and they can\nnever be satisfactorily answered.\nThis is a significant point. Children have faith in a Santa Claus\nof one sort or another, and in their having m others. Somehow\nthe faith in Santa Claus fades away, but having mothers is\nnever questioned. (Feminists have a point, then, when they say\nthere could never have been a female Descartes.) The demand\nthat one should doubt even the existence of one's body, then,\nis only understandable in the sense that the extant scientific\ntheories of bodies should be doubted. Indeed, the idealists who\ndenied the existence of matter did not question the\ncommonsense view of matter and of their own having emerged\nout of their mothers' wombs. They questioned the theory of\nmatter propounded by Descartes, by Newton, or by other\nphysicists. It is no accident that the Baconian program and its\nexecution by Descartes concerned the improvement of the\nnatural sciences and technologies, hardly the improvement of\nthe social sciences (or the moral sciences, to use the\nantiquated terminology), and even less so the social and\npolitical technologies. The application of the Baconian program\nto social and political studies came later, as an afterthought,\nand its application to political affairs was unexpected and\nbizarre.\nThe Baconian project -- his plan to develop science - - was a\ngreat success, as was his idea that technology will develop\nmagnificently on scientific foundations. His view was e choed by\nhis followers John Locke, David Hume, and, above all, Adam\nSmith (Hal\xe9vy, 1955, p. 433). During the French Revolution it\nwas echoed by Condorcet (1976; see also Schapiro, 1934). It\nwas the faith that scientific -technological progress will\ninevitably improve social matters without much ado. This\nBaconian aspiration -- to save humanity through the\nadvancement of science and technology -- failed totally,\nalthough not before it landed humanity in the modern world --\nindustrial, post-industrial, and developing -- for better or\nworse.\nThe first great fiasco of the Baconian program to save humanity\nthrough the advancement of science and technology was the\nFrench Revolution. The idea is not new that the revolution was\nthe daughter of the ideas of the Enlightenment movement,\nespecially its radicalism. This idea was advanced by the leading\nReactionary thinkers, Edmund Burke and Georg Wilhelm\nFriedrich Hegel (see Agassi, 1977, pp. 218 -20). They did not\nsay it out right, but their followers did: People want to b e\ndeceived. They want that because they cannot practice self -\nreliance. This Reactionary idea helped the tyrants of the\nmodern, developed world immensely, and caused untold harm.\nThe Reaction had much less of a vision and no program, yet\nbeing conservative it could always fall back on tradition. The\ncentral idea of the Reaction, then, was that people need\ntradition to tell them what to believe in. This takes the central\nidea of the Reaction out of the present discourse. The Reaction\nmade a concession to the Enlightenment movement: Some\nindividuals can be self -reliant. They prove it by going into the\ndesert and staying there without food, drink, or company for\nforty days and forty nights. The Reaction deprived even the few\nself- reliant individuals of their reason: They are exceptional\nbecause they are extremely ambitious, and they follow their\nown bent no matter what. This is a recommendation for self-\ndeception on a grand scale. It suggests that the exceptional\nmust be lonely and stubborn, which is what cha racterizes many\npsychopathological cases. Indeed, Hegel said there is no way to\ndistinguish between the exceptional who is a genius from the\none who is crazy, or alienated, to use the term of Pinel: To be\njudged alienated (by accepted norms) is the price for one's\ndecision to be self -reliant (until one manages to alter the\nnorms and then be declared a hero). The Reactionary doctrine\nof dependence and self - reliance is a gross exaggeration. Let us\nreturn to a more commonsensical version of rationalism\n(Agassi, 1981b, Chapter 15.)\nExtreme Rationalism as Self- Deception\nNo rule of logic is more potent than that which proscribes\ncontradictions: They are deadly. Not only are they\ndemonstrably false; declaring one true is the denial of all error,\nand so it is the admission of every possible statement.\nNevertheless, a mathematical text can all too easily include\none. In mathematics a misprint may introduce an error, and\nintroducing an error into a mathematical system usually\namounts to adding a contradiction to it (the equation 1 + 2 = 3\nbecomes a contradiction when any one item in it is misprinted).\nStrictly, the rule banning all contradictions renders all texts\nthat contain such misprints worthless. However, it is often easy\nto eliminate misprints by simply overlooking them, and this is\ndone heedlessly unless and until they cause trouble. Even\nresearchers whose ideas seem inconsistent are known to\nproceed working without worry about inconsistency, in the hope\nthat this matter will be taken care of later. It is hard to judge\nhow rational this attitude is; in the oversight of inconsistency,\none risks the waste of time in the study of a worthless system.\nIf the system under study happens to be consistent, or if the\ninconsistency in it is easy to remove, the result of the study\nmay be useful. However, often a researcher investing much\nefforts in some interesting question will obtain exciting results\nthat rest on an inconsistency, so that the invested labor was\nsheer waste.\nHere is an interesting corollary to the theory of self-deception.\nIt is one thing to take a calculated risk, regardless of whether\nthe end result is happy. It is quite another thing to pretend to\nhave taken a calculated risk, be optimistic about matters, and\nforge ahead carelessly. Often the investment o f effort is only of\nsome pleasant hours of research that one may easily afford to\nlose. It is an observed fact that if stakes are high and the\nresearcher is highly strung, self -deception steps in as the\nrefusal to entertain the merest possibility of an error. It is hard\nto differentiate the reasonable cases of calculated risk from the\ncases of carelessness, as there is no theory that tells us when\nthe risk is great and when not. Perhaps there can be no such\ntheory regarding research.\nSo much for the requirement for consistency. It is more\ndifficult to study other requirements, as these may be\nabandoned. This is the case with demonstrability - - the super-\ncriterion traditionally most generally adhered to and rightly\nmost respected. It is invalid; adherence to it causes confusion\nand self -deception. Without the assumption that philosophers\naddicted to it are deluding themselves, it is hard to explain its\npopularity, despite its great allure. Historically, it is a central\nidea, and yet today it is recognized as most baffling. What is\ndemonstrability? What theory of it is there? As its natural place\nis in mathematics, it can be examined there first.\nThe standard examples of demonstrations -- of proofs -- are\nmathematical, especially those of Euclid and of Archimedes. By\nmodern standards, the quality of these demonstrations is very\nlow. Russell (1917, pp. 66, 94-50) said that Euclid's proofs\nscarcely qualify. The first to have offered reasonable proofs,\nsaid Russell, was George Boole, at the mid -19th century (p.\n74). In classical geometry, proofs consisted of deductions from\nthe axioms of geometry. What follows from a theorem is a\ntheorem, yet two nagging questions remained unanswered.\nFirst, what makes the axioms theorems? Answer: Axioms are\nself-evident: it is impossible to question their truth. Yet at\nleast one axiom of Euclid was always questioned (for each\nstraight line no more than one parallel line goes through a\ngiven point). In the 19th century, a system of geometry was\nconstructed in which that axiom was relinquished. Early in the\n20th century, Einstein developed a theory of gravity whose\ngeometry is non-Euclidean. (It denies that space is the same\neverywhere, as it assumes that the properties of space differ\nwhere gravity differs.) So much for the self-ev idence of axioms.\nThe other question is, how is proof possible without axioms? It\nhas to do with the theorems in the fields of arithmetic and of\nalgebra. These were not based on axioms until early in the 20th\ncentury.\nSo much for proofs. As to proof theo ry, it was developed in the\n1930s by combined efforts of a few great logicians. Their work\nwas clouded by confusions, most of which were cleared decades\nlater. Perhaps even now, proof theory is too problematic, so\nthat perhaps we are still not entitled to claim possession of a\nclear proof theory, not even in logic and mathematics.\nYet the puzzling fact is that classical rationalist philosophy\nrested on the idea that rationality equals proof. An example of\nthe magnitude of the puzzlement may be useful, especially as it\nprovides the flavor of the feeling that accompanies the\nsituation. The classical and most popular work of Wittgenstein\n(1922, Preface and famous last sentence) is accompanied by an\nair of tremendous tension: It declares that, on the one hand,\nwhat it says is so obvious that its articulation is neither\npossible nor called for, and on the other hand it is so difficult\nthat it is beyond words. Much controversy rages as to how to\nread his text, and much of it revolves around the question of\nproof and provability, and of what exactly the message about it\nis. Possibly, however, the literature in question is a mere\nexpression of a tremendous sense of frustration at the inability\nof commentators to face their own inability to prove, which is\nto say tha t the literature in question is a mere exercise in the\nfutility of self-deception.\nAs proof theory developed, it was proved that all effective\nproof procedures are limited, even in mathematics, let alone\nelsewhere, were proof elsewhere at all possible. T he proof --\nG\xf6del's celebrated proof -- was rejected by Wittgenstein. In the\nmeantime, the matter has developed much further, and proof\nprocedures and their limitations have become a field of\nintensive study within computer science. What is not provable\nin one system may be provable in another, as it can be added\nas an axiom; but their addition will create other unprovable\ntheorems. Contrary to Wittgenstein, there is no comprehensive\nsystem in which the logical status of all that can be said is\ndecided once and for all.\nThe idea that rationality equals proof is most basic. It is the\nsource of much strength, but also of much self-deception --\nwithin philosophy as well as within science. Bacon,\nWittgenstein, and many others said, when in doubt one should\nrefrain from endorsing any opinion, one should suspend\njudgment, and one should never express any opinion about\nwhat is doubtful, particularly not in public. Otherwise, self-\ndeception is inevitable. This idea, hostile to self-deception as it\nis, looks immune to it. The fear that it is itself the malady it\ncomes to cure is as frightening as the idea that physicians\ncause death. The fear that the medicine is worse than the ills it\ncomes to cure produces a feeling of helplessness, and that\nfeeling is a tremendous incentive for self -deception. Indeed,\nthis is what happened when Semmelweis brought crucial\nempirical evidence to support the claim that physicians kill\npatients by not washing their hands. For decades his view and\nhis prescription were rejected by his peers. This is a clear case\nof a dangerous, irresponsible, grand -scale self-deception,\npracticed by a scientifically oriented group.\nHowever erroneous classical rationalism is, it is still very\npopular among philosophers who like it for its advocacy of the\nuse of reason and its support of science and of self -reliance.\nYet it is itself a case of self-deception. These days, the rule of\nscience is tacitly identified as the acceptance of the expert's\nauthority. This is very disconcerting, as any acceptance of any\nauthority is, as it conflicts with the demand for self- reliance. It\nis also silly. It is well known that the acceptance of the expert's\nauthority may be fatal (see last paragraph for an example). The\nstandard answer to this trite observation is that the reliance on\nexperts is unavoidable in the modern world. Even it were\nunavoidable, this does not make it less fatal. Moreover, the\nunavoidability of the reliance on experts has nothing particular\nto do with the modern world: It has always been the case, an d\nit is much less so today, when the educated citizen knows more\nmedicine than the best physician of a century ago. As the\nhypothesis that there is no choice but to rely on experts is\nrefuted, it may be replaced with increasingly better hypotheses\nthat wil l say how far and under which conditions the reliance on\nthe experts' authority is worse than doing altogether without\nthem. The reliance on experts' authority is clearly the worst\nsuperstition of the allegedly rationalist and the allegedly\nscientifically inclined, and this includes most research scientists\naround (Feyerabend, 1970).\nSelf- Deception as Fixation\nBacon's doctrine of prejudice was limited to the prejudices of\nthe researchers. Marx extended it to the views -- the prejudices\n-- extant in the gene ral population, especially the extant\nphilosophy of life. He labeled it 'ideology'. Following Hegel he\ndenied the universalism of the Enlightenment movement, and\nreplaced it with the view that the parochial views are locally\nvalid. (Hegel called the views and attitudes agreeable to the\nstate 'the Universal'.) This theory is known as relativism or,\nmore specifically, epistemic and moral relativism (see Agassi,\n1992). Every period of history, Hegel said, has its own truths,\nas created by the heroes who are the leading lights of that\nperiod. These heroes together constitute the group of\nindividuals who count -- &#34;the World Historical Figures.&#34; Marx\naccepted Hegel's epistemic and moral relativism only for the\npast -- for class society. He declared the truth in a class\nsociety to be socially determined, but he taught that, in\nclassless society, the truly universal would prevail. Hence, in a\nclass society all truths are relative and socially determined.\nHence, all ideology is class prejudice. Being prejudices,\nideologies are hard to shake off. This can only be done by\nindividuals who can peer into the mechanisms of history, like\nMarx himself -- they can divine the future society and the\ntruths of that society.\nAccording to Marx the society of his day was ruled by\nemployers, by the capitalists. He predicted that the ruling class\nof his day were destined to be replaced by employees, by the\nworkers. He viewed other philosophers as captives of capitalist\nprejudices. He viewed himself as the mouthpiece of the future\nsociety. He viewed the prejudices of the capitalists inferior to\nthose of the workers. He therefore held the view that the views\nhe was holding were superior to those held by other\nphilosophers.\nThis is Hegelian: The top representative of humanity, be it the\ntop nation (Hegel), top class (Marx), top civilization or culture\n(Spengler, Toynbee), or anything else that is tops, is tops in\neach and every respect. Hegel had a simple justification for this\nbizarre idea: The best is the militarily strongest, and the\nstrongest takes all that is of value -- the way Napoleon robbed\nthe countries he conquered of their artwork. Hegel and Marx\nnever explained why the arts and sciences always progress and\nthey disregarded the historical facts of regress. The most\nconspicuous fact that Greek art and science are superior to\nmediaeval art and science was brushed aside with the aid of\nthe claim for the superiority of the mediaeval political system\nor its agricultural technology over its predecessors. This is only\nevidence that being superior in one dimension is no guarantee\nfor superiority in another. This option did not occur to Marx nor\nto Marxist scholars in the middle of the 20th century. (The\nfamous scientist and historian of science J. D. Bernal (1939,\nChapter 2, Section 1) declared flippantly that medieval science\nis superior to Greek science. (See also Bernal, 1952, 1954, p.\n209; Agassi, 1963, Chapter 7 and notes.)\nTraditionally, philosophy was reductionist: It recommended that\nevents that belong to the different human sc iences should be\nexplained by theories from only one human science. Traditional\nreduction was to psychology: All human science, it was\nsuggested, are at heart psychology: Sociology, politics and\neconomics are really parts of psychology. Bacon's doctrine of\nprejudice was perhaps behind this trend. When Hegel reduced\nthe individual to society and declared political history the basic\nhuman science, he declared it essential for sanity to believe in\nnational myths. Marx advocated the reduction of all human\nsciences to economics. He wanted to see all explanation of\nhuman affairs by reference to the economic conditions of the\nsociety in which they occur, chiefly in terms of the\nadvancement of its technology. Freud, however, clung to the\ntraditional recommendation to reduce all human phenomena to\npsychology. He attempted to explain the way some private\nprejudices have a strong hold on the minds of their victims: He\nwas impressed by the fact that neuroses constitute intellectual\nblind spots, especially when the neurotics who sustain them are\nintelligent. He explained this by his theory of the emotional\ntrauma ('trauma' means wound).\nFreud's theory of the emotional trauma is simple. The cause of\nevery neurosis, he suggested, is a trauma caused by some\nfrightening, painful childhood event. Initially, the trauma leads\nto an attempt to cope with it by conjecturing a hypothesis.\nBeing infantile, this hypothesis is not surprisingly of a low\nintellectual level. What is surprising is that the neurotic never\ngets over the init ial hypothesis. This, Freud explained, is due to\ntwo facts. First, reliving the traumatic incident is painful.\nSecond, one attempts to avoid that pain. For example, if one\nconjectures that the pain in question is caused by the rejection\ndue to one's lack o f achievement, one will increase one's\nefforts to achieve. The refutation of the hypothesis will only\nlead to redoubling the effort, rather than to recognizing that no\neffort will reverse the rejection (because one tries to achieve\nthe wrong object, becaus e the rejection is irreversible, because\nthere was no rejection to begin with, or because of anything\nelse). Therefore, the purpose of psychoanalytic treatment\nshould be liberating neurotics from the prejudices that are at\nthe base of their neurotic conduct, which incapacitates them.\nThis, according to Freud, can be achieved only by helping them\nrelive their initial traumatic experiences. Once this is achieved,\npatients experience strong relief and a sense of catharsis, and\nthen, according to Freud, all is well.\nThis is Freud's celebrated catharsis theory. He later claimed to\nhave refuted it to his own satisfaction. It is difficult to say what\nreplaced catharsis as the aim of psychoanalytic treatment after\nthat theory was abandoned. Possibly Freud was too hasty to\nreject the theory; Possibly the fault was not in the ascription of\ntherapeutic power to catharsis, but in the view that, after it,\nthe patient is well and the treatment is over. I (Agassi, 1981a)\nhave suggested that the recovered mental patient ne eds\ntreatment that is usually accorded to the physically\nconvalescent. When a convalescent has weak muscles, it\nmatters little why; the question is, how should they be\nstrengthened? The same may be true of the mentally\nconvalescent, whose decision power is small. If so, what\nprecisely the prejudice was that the catharsis reveals is less\nimportant than the treatment accorded to willing mentally\nconvalescents. This shows that Freud's theory is one of self -\ndeception. It is a model for a number of such theories , yet not\na sufficiently good one, as it does not take into account the\natrophy of self -reliance due to prolonged neurosis. Freud has\nrightly observed that adolescents often get rid of their\nprejudices, but not those acquired under severe traumas --\ninclud ing morality, which is thus inculcated under the\nconditions of brainwashing, said Feyerabend (1968).\nSelf- deception can be treated in all generality. It is rational to\ninquire, to seek the truth, but perhaps not at any cost. At\ntimes, the search for the truth is too costly, and its outcome is\nof little significance. In these cases, it is reasonable to give up\nthe quest. This is a troublesome catch. One remains ignorant,\nfirst, of the truth that one allows to remain hidden, and then\nalso of the cost of giv ing it up - - of relinquishing it. More than\nBacon, Freud renders self -deception as the opposite of the\nsearch for the truth. He insisted more on the relentless search\nfor the truth. Yet the limitation on the cost of the search for\nthe truth remains. Select iveness is unavoidable, and one about\nthe search for the truth is inherently blind. What should be\ndone about this? Freud was troubled by interminable analysis,\nwhich is an expression of both the excessive cost of analysis\nand its contribution to the increased atrophy of the patient's\nself- reliance.\nThis is where Freud got stuck. Bacon's doctrine relates to the\nsearch for the scientific truth. He said the search should not be\nselective, because any selection is guided by an idea, and that\nidea is a prejud ice: It is judgment prior to the presentation of\nthe relevant evidence. Even asking specific question, Bacon\nsaid, is selective. The choice of a question is rooted in a\nprejudice. To avoid prejudice, research must be indiscriminate\nand all discovery accide ntal. Freud's view of his own research\nwas orthodox Baconian; his claim that his theory evolved out of\nmyriads of observations was clearly Baconian; his suggestion\nthat analysts intervene minimally in the analytic process of\nself-discovery was based on his fear of prejudice. Yet his\ntheory was related to everyday life, where the question about\nthe search for the truth cannot be as all encompassing as in\nresearch. Thus, he could not say how neuroses-free the\naverage citizen should be (Freud, 1962, third para graph from\nthe end).\nFreud appealed to simple common sense: One often deviates\nfrom the normal healthy views of things, and one is then\nnormally corrected by circumstances or by peers. It is abnormal\nto resist this kind of correction. Abnormal resistance to\ncommon sense is at times intelligent, as in the case of a\nresearch scientist. Alternatively, it is sometimes unintelligent,\nat other times it is hardly a trouble, and still other times it\nincapacitates. This then requires treatment. Here then is the\nplace for Freud's original contribution: The neurotic resistance\nis still rational, although it is obsessive (i.e., pathological). It\nis the insistence of avoiding the pain of reliving the trauma.\nThis is a hurdle the incapacitated should be helped to clear.\nReluctance to discuss one's opinions rationally is the outcome\nof the assessment that discussion will be painful. However, one\nis never able to assess properly the cost of the reluctance to\nacquire information for want of that very information. Therefore\none should always be ready to reassess one's view that the\npain is not worth the benefit. If common sense calls for this\nreassessment and is met with an obsessive refusal, perhaps the\ncause is psychopathological. Otherwise, the resistance is better\ndiagnosed differently, especially when it expresses the fear of\nself- reliance ('decidophobia' is the apt term offered by\nKaufmann, 1973).\nConclusion: The New Theory of Rationality\nThe discussion thus far is couched within common sense or in a\nframework that diffe rs radically from the classical theory of\nrationality. Since Freud fully endorsed that theory, his\ndiscussion was possibly inconsistent -- in that it mixed common\nsense with the classical theory of rationality. Even if it is\nconsistent, it is encumbered with irrelevant difficulties, and in\nits original wording it is much harder to comprehend than its\n(more general) variant reproduced here.\nThe discussion herein also deviates from the classical theory of\nrationality in its avoidance of the theory that the rational is the\nprovable. Nor does it require an explicit wording of an\nalternative theory of rationality. The new theory of rationality\nthat is required should share with common sense the idea that\nthere is no human perfection. It should not assume any pa rt or\naspect of any product of the human mind to be perfect and\nabove error. Briefly, it should include the idea that it is\ndesirable to eliminate error as far as possible; it suggests that\nthis is done by criticism. Criticism, then, should be viewed not\nas hostile, but as help. This idea is not new, and is clearly\nexpressed in Plato's Gorgias. Yet in the writings of Plato (and\nAristotle) the rationality of criticism is presented as a mere\npreliminary to the rationality of proof. Omitting this, we receive\nthe new theory of rationality, or a variant of it: Critical\ndiscussion is not the appetizer but the main course. Hence, it is\nnot just concerning received opinions, as Plato and Aristotle\nsuggested, but an endless process of inventing ever newer\nconjectures and their refutations -- as much as is within the\npowers of the participants in the process Popper, 1945,\n[Agassi, 1995). (This raises the question, is logic perfect, and\nis mathematics? These matters are not discussed here,\nalthough they are of great philosophical interest.)\nThe assumption that criticism is rational is very rational, and\nits rejection by Bacon and his followers is a great pity,\nalthough Bacon was right to observe that critical discussion as\npracticed in the universities was an exercise in futility. The first\nmodern variant of the fallibilist theory of rationality, which\nincorporates the assumption that rationality is critical debate,\nis due to Popper (1945, Chapter 24). His theory is not free of\nobjections, especially Bacon's. Criticism may be pointless at\ntimes. It can also be an unaffordable luxury. It is impossible to\nknow if this applies to the case at hand. The theory under\nconsideration may deserve criticism and it may not: Investing\nin criticism risks wasting valuable time.\nExamp les of irrational critical thinking abound, and at times\nthey can be classified as pathological. Psychotherapists are\nfamiliar with many kinds of them. Patients are often ingenious\nat inventing new excuses that allow them to ignore or belittle\ncriticism of their views and conduct. Patients are likewise\ningenious at inventing criticisms of, and in finding lacunae in,\nthe assumptions behind threatening proposals of therapists.\nPeople often use many tools -- physical or mental -- without\nbothering about their inner mechanisms. When patients are\nafraid of using a proposal made by their therapists, they\nsuddenly show passionate interest in the mechanisms involved\nin the proposal and in critical debates about them. These\npassionate interests are delay tactics and expressions of fear.\nThe observation of Konrad Lorenz is relevant here: Conduct\nunder fear and pressure is less intelligent than the average in\nall animals. The claim made here is that even losing one's mind\nis a process due to rational conduct, but in fea r and under\ngreat stress, and so with an ever-decreasing level of rationality\n(Fried &amp; Agassi, 1976).\nThus, there are levels of rationality; the highest level available\nis hardly ever attained. It is approached only in some very\nleisurely, research -oriented discussions. Even then it is not\nalways clear what avenue is best to take (contrary to classical\nrationalism), as there are many possibilities, some of them\ninherently blind. Thus, it is only seldom clear how the level of\nrationality can be raised. Tha t the rationality of action may be\na matter of degree is common sense, and if all rationality\nshould be seen as a matter of degree, it is useful to view\nrational thought as a variant of rational action. Traditionally,\nrational thought, or rational opinion, was distinguished from\nrational action (including thinking). This is reinforced by the\ntraditional distinction between states (of mind) and (mental)\nprocesses. This distinction is subtle and redundant: Jarvie and I\n(Agassi &amp; Jarvie, 1987) have suggested to v iew thought as a\nkind of action and the theory of rational thought as a part of\nthe theory of rational action. This is meat to be a supplement\nto Popper's theory of rationality.\nThere are two points to mention before bringing this chapter to\na close. First, unlike the classical theory of rationality, the\nfallibilist theory does not split rationality sharply to the\nscientific and the rest. It also recognizes common sense and its\nprogress. (Think of the views of nutrition common a century\nago, which reco mmended what is today viewed as empty\ncalories and/or a cholesterol-rich diet; or of sexuality, which\ndeemed masturbation self-destructive and the pleasure of sex\nundesired by decent women.) It also takes for granted that, in\nscience as elsewhere, every significant criticism is an\ninvention, so that it is important to see the difficulty of being\ncritical (and so of being highly rational). This relates to the\nsecond point. The fear of criticism is rational, but not as\nrational as the effort to overcome it. Self-deception is thus a\nform of rational human conduct, but it is inferior to attempts to\novercome fear and more so to fearless openness. This is not to\nsay that every possible case of self -deception is equally\nharmful and to be equally harshly combated. O ften\npsychotherapists encounter cases that they judge -- hopefully\nrightly - - as not deserving treatment. The cases that do\ndeserve treatment, even at a great cost, Freud noted, are those\nthat grossly interfere with the ordinary course of life. Some\ncases are subtle and difficult to judge. A sense of proportion\nmust prevail in discussing them. The pursuit of the truth is\nlaudable, but it is not necessarily always the required\ntreatment.\nA sense of proportion is indispensable anyway, since there is no\ngreater self -deception than the claim that one is utterly free of\nit, as is regrettably exemplified by the great thinkers Bacon,\nMarx, and Freud. This should be remembered as a warning\nagainst excessive self -confidence: Humans are all fallible and,\nas Plato already observed in great detail, it behooves us to be\ngrateful for any attempt at criticism and correction.\nAppendix\nThe editor has drawn my attention to a very recent essay by\nAlfred R. Mele (Mele, 1996), that deserves notice because it\ncomprises a very comprehensive survey of the most recent\nliterature on self-deception, which is becoming increasingly\nfashionable these days. The literature is written from the\nviewpoint of the theory of rationality as the rational degree of\nbelief and that as the degree to which the belief is justified by\nexperience. This viewpoint was declared in this chapter as a\nversion of self-deception, perhaps also an expression of some\nanxiety. The starting -pint of that literature is the so-called\nparadox of self -deception. Assume that successful deception\noccurs when one who thinks that some statement is true\nconvinces someone else that it is not. Assume further that one\nsuccessfully deceives oneself the same way. As a result, one\ndoes and does not think that the statement in question is true.\nAs was explained here, it is easier to begin with self -deception\nand view most cases of deception as variants of it. As explained\nin this chapter, self-deception is always a form of ambiguity\nand/or confusion and ignorance, so that it is a spectrum, and\nthere is no sharp division between those engaged in it and\nthose who keep clear of it, although some people are very near\nthe one end of the spectrum and others on the other.\nMele reports numerous experiments in self -deception, with no\nregard to th e question, how well trained the subjects of the\nexperiment are in the art of self -criticism. The absence of self-\ncriticism, it was argued in this chapter, is not the same as self-\ndeception, especially since all criticism is the result of some\ncreative act . There is also the question of the cost of self -\ncriticism that the experiments discussed by Mele disregard. The\nexperimenters do not ask, how important is the self-deception\nunder discussion and how important the individuals in question\nconsiders it. Most engagement in astrology by modern educated\npeople is a mild, harmless form of self -deception that cannot\nbe taken as seriously as the case of self -deception that leads to\ndisaster.\nReferences\nAgassi, J.

Jarvie, eds., Transition to Modernity: Essays on Power, Wealth and\nBelief, Gellner Festschrift, Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1991, 213-30.\nDeconstructing Post-Modernism: Gellner and Crocodile Dundee\nJoseph Agassi\nTel-Aviv University and York University, Toronto\nAbstract and Introduction.\nThis essay is an attempt to dispense with the negative aspects of\nRomanticism and examine whatever positive it has to offer--in the light of\nideas scattered through diverse writings of Ernest Gellner.\nA paragraph on the negative side of Romanticism, however, is in order,\nsince Romanticism is negative at base: it developed in understandable\ndisillusionment over the excessively optimistic claims of the\nEnlightenment after the fiasco of the French Revolutio n and its aftermath.\nIts discontent was wider than the Enlightenment, however: it was a\ndiscontent with civilization as such, as was argued by Sigmund Freud in\nCivilization and its Discontents. The discontent, Freud suggested, was\nunderstandable: civilization is repressive: we inculcate in our charges a\ndisastrous distaste for food and for sex. There is no dissent from Freud on\nthis; it is obviously in our tradition to create in our charges distaste for\nthe appetites we share with other animals; thus, the continuing appeal of\nthese appetites creates &#34;animalism,&#34; the desire to emulate other animals\nall the way, expressed, for example, in the writings of Count Gobineau\nand of D.H. Lawrence. This negativism, understandable as it is (and\nLawrence autobiographical Sons and Lovers makes it hard not to\nsympathize with it), has no saving grace. Yet Romanticism also has\nsomething positive to offer: a search for integration, meaning, de-\nalienation. Can the positive ideas of Romanticism possibly be detached\nfrom the negative? Post-modernism is an attempt to answer this\naffirmatively and in detail. The question deserves a better treatment.\nThe Modern Vision was the vision of the Enlightenment Movement of the\nAge of Reason. It was a vision of a peaceful world governed by\nscientifically oriented sweet reasonableness. The Romantic Movement\ngained its popularity more through its criticism of the Enlightenment\nMovement than through its positive substitute for it. The Romantic\nMovement presented the Enlightenment as alienating, as contributing to\nthe alienation and tedium that are characteristic of the modern world.\nStill, the Romantic Movement did attempt to offer an alternative to the\nModern Vision, or at least a semblance of one: the Romantic Vision. This\nwas a vision of integrated communal life, governed by tradition and by\nmeaningful traditional values, yet decidedly not opposed to progress. It is\nhard, if not impossible, to hold a consistent, workable model of a society\nrun by a mixture of tradition and progress. Critics of the Romantic\nMovement rightly noted that traditionalism forced the Romantic\nMovement into the Reactionary mould: its progressivism was a ruse. Even\nits nationalism, its advocacy of national autonomy was a ruse for its\nReactionary hostility to individual autonomy: it supported the national\nright to self-determination as a substitute for the individual right to self-\ndetermination (which the Enlightenment Movement supported and the\nReaction rejected.)\nThe mixture that the Romanticism offered, of tradition and progress, was\nnaturally fascinating; it offered a reasonable challenge to generations of\nReactionary sociology and anthropology, including Durkheim and Tennis.\nThe Post-modern Vision thus slowly evolved into its present state. It is\ncheap, but it cannot easily be dismissed. Perhaps it can best be\nsymbolized by Crocodile Dundee, a popular mythological hero. Unlike the\nModernist Superman, Batman and their likes, who are firmly rooted in\nscience fiction and &#34;the American way&#34;, Dundee is both modern and\nprim itive (Australian bush style) and, of course, he incorporates the\nvirtues of both the Modern and the Romantic visions in a fashion as vulgar\nas the public can tolerate: he is a true Post-modern.\nThe fantastic character of popular mythology stems from its admitting the\nimpossible or the barely possible as facts; the post-modern mythology\noffers as fact the suggestion that the Enlightenment and Romanticism can\nbe fused to yield a blend of the best of each. To deconstruct a myth, then,\nmay be the proper way, perhaps the best mythical expression of the Post-\nmodern Vision; as such he is a comic -strip version of what Gellner\npresents as the new Promethean Vision.\nGellner offers a way of dismantling the various characteristics of modern\nindustrial society that our predecessors have accepted and we have\ninherited from them in order to see if we cannot reconstitute it differently.\nThe contrast between the superficiality and vulgarity of the Dundee myth\nand the depth and breadth of Gellner's works should not blind us to their\nshared vision. It may be the best we have, anyway. This is my plea for\ndiscussing the very possibility of its realization.\nThe Romantic and the Post-modern Visions of Integration\nPerhaps the most famous criticism of the Modern Vision of society in\nwhich classical social science is embedded is this: the vision is atomistic;\nthus, naturally, pursuing it leads to a society of disjoint individuals. This\ncriticism is valid. Atomos and individuum are etymologically synonyms,\nafter all, the latter term being the former Greek term Latinized. And the\nEnlightenment's individualism was thoroughly reductionist: all social\nphenomena, it taught, should be analyzed in terms of individuals and\ntheir non-human environments. The Romantics had no theory beyond the\nclaim that rootless individuals are alienated, i.e., they have lost direction;\nunless they are endowed with characteristics of both heroes and geniuses\nand are engaged in the growing of new roots for some future societies,\nthey are lost for good. The scantiness of this idea led to the proposal to\nneglect social studies, especially economics and rational political theory,\nnot to mention cognitive psychology, and to concentrate instead on\nhistorical studies, especially of one's roots, namely folklore and such. This\nsuggestion bloomed into a vision of a golden age of the integrated\ncommunities of our forefathers. This vision was first taken as frankly\nmythical, yet it has become a more realistic and informative part of an\noverall image, provided by social anthropology. The myth of the golden\nage became the empirical scientific study of pre-literate society. Pre-\nliterate society has severe shortcomings and limitations and defects and\neven ugliness. With all of its undesirable aspects, however, pre -literate\nsociety has one enormous superiority over the modern world. It is a\nunified community. One cannot separate the religion of pre -literate\nsociety from its art, technology, or daily life: they are all one; industrial\nsociety, in contradistinction, is atomized; its diverse aspects are as\nfragmented or compartmentalized as possible by a strict division of labor\nthat has replaced the integrated happy farmer and artisan with the self-\nalienated conveyor-belt worker.\nThis image is one which was first offered philosophically, not empirically;\nonly after its philosophical variant, the Romantic Vision, was thoroughly\ndiscredited (see below) was it rendered empirical, enabling to have a\ncome-back, without suffering summary dismissal, as the Post-modern\nVision. In both variants, Romanticism and Post-modernism, it was\nopposed to the Modern Vision of the Enlightenment Movement. The most\nrecent example cited in Gellner's writings is a quotation from Marshall\nSahlin's, wherein the classical philosophical, perhaps even moralistic,\ncriticism of the Economic Man of the Enlightenment Movement as selfish,\nself-centered, lost and self-alienated, is replaced with the image of the\nhunter and gatherer as the Uneconomic Man; want not, lack not. It\nfollows from the empirical descriptions on which Sahlin relies, Gellner\nobserves, that the agricultural revolution, viewed traditionally as a great\nboon, &#34;was a catastrophe, both moral and material, not a glorious\nachievement&#34; (Plough, Sword and Book, p.32).\nGellner himself is a supporter of progress, but he comes to examine its\ncost, and the possibility of canceling ancient debts so as to be able to\nretrieve some old lost property. There is no doubt that Gellner has no\npatience for the campy anthropologists who pretend that magic is equal\nto science in descriptive and technological power. Nor does he consider\nthe relativist claim that the truth is divided, that our truth may equal\ntheirs: to the contrary, we live in one world, is his slogan. Nevertheless,\nhe tries to exonerate magic. Though science in his view caused &#34;the great\ndivide&#34; between the advanced and the less advanced parts of the one\nworld, there is value to the magic that was lost with the advent of literacy\nand more so with the rise of science. Magic -systems are vague, &#34;non-\nreferential&#34; (not endorsing the ideal permit their followers a higher degree\nof integration than is to be found in the modern scientific -industrial\nsociety. &#34;What on earth, literally,&#34; he asks (Plough, Sword and Book, p.\n78), &#34;could ever induce or enable the various tentacles to cut themselves\noff from the non-referential main body?&#34; His answer to this question\nmakes his philosophy new. The chief target of his criticism is the Modern\nVision, even that vision updated. Those to whom he sounds Romantic,\nhowever, do not hear his intended message: limited in their choice of\noptions they fail to entertain, or even to comprehend, his proposal to\nconsider the cost of atomization and the cost of moving forward, not\nbackward.\nThe Romantic Vision came first as a philosophical visio n because it was a\nbackward gaze, and so a fake one, not given to empirical examination, if\nonly because it was openly anti-scientific; hence it was not given to\nempirical support. In the present age, when science is highly prestigious,\nit is a handicap to be anti-scientific. This handicap was removed only very\nrecently: the peak of the Post-modern Vision, of the empirical variant of\nthe Romantic Vision, is the recent work of Paul K. Feyerabend (Philosophy\nof the Social Sciences, 1988), in which Western science is viewed as a\ntradition and is placed within a set of systems of knowledge so -called, all\ntraditional. The scientific tradition is not always the most advantageous,\nFeyerabend observes. Also, it is supremacist and even imperialistic and\nthus highly objectionable: it ruthlessly destroys other systems of\nknowledge [especially the pre -literate, magically oriented ones, those\nbetter conforming to the Romantic Vision].\nThese, then, are the philosophical Romantic Vision and the (pseudo-)\nempirical Post-modern Vision. The enormous cost of our having\nentertained its philosophical variant in the recent past is the topic of the\nnext paragraph; the cost of continuing to entertain it will be discussed in\nthe rest of the next section.\nThe Romantic and the Post-modern Vision.\nHumanity has paid dearly for the Romantic Vision, for the Romantic quest\nfor integration. In the period between the Reaction to the French\nRevolution (1814) and the end of World War II (1945), in the period that\nmay be called the Romantic Era, the quest for integration was the main\nfeature of the Romantic populist ideology. It played almost the same role\nin all Reactionary politics, official, semi-official, unofficial and academic,\nand culminating with Fascist and Nazi politics. The exceptional variant\nwas, of course, official Soviet politics that, though populist and\nReactionary, had a veneer of progressive ideology. An episode in Soviet\nhistory, known as Zhadanovschina (after the name of its official advocate\nAndr\xe9 Zhadanov), epitomized this populism, which deviated from the\nRomantic Vision in that its placing the golden age not in the (primitive)\npast but in the (technologically advanced) future. Yet, like all other\nReactionary regimes of the Romantic Era, Soviet Russia, too, made use of\nchauvinist and other supremacist theories, and they all did so on the\nground that these were at the time scientifically respectable. (This is an\nargument in favor of Feyerabend's criticism of science; he does not use it,\nhowever, preferring to speak of Europe's recent past only elliptically.) So\nmuch for the incalculable damage caused by the populist adherence to the\nRomantic Vision, to the quest for integrated society.\nAll this evil is past history: the Post-modern Vision, the new variant of the\nRomantic Visio n, is certainly not European supremacist: it is routinely\nunderstood as a criticism of supremacism and of any other form of\nparochialism (see I.C. Jarvie, The Revolution in Anthropology , and\nGellner's preface there). It has been accused of Reactionary tendencies,\nbut if this is so, then it is a new kind of Reaction: those social\nanthropologists who write scientific progress-reports and make\ndocumentary films extolling pre -literate tribes in accord with the Romantic\nVision present propaganda, but not as political activity. Therefore, the\nPost-modern Vision is treated these days as a respectable doctrine,\nthough as a mere idle dream, just because it is a nice dream--nice in that\nit is friendly to pre-literate people and so it is not imperialistic nor racist\nnor whatever else is associated with supremacist Reactionary politics.\nTaking it for granted that the Post-modern Vision is benign, lending it\nrespectability has its cost; the cost may be assessed and possibly\nreduced.\nThe cost of taking the Romantic Vision and its diverse broad topic. The\ncost of the very indulgence towards the Post-modern Vision as an idle\ndream is easier to assess, at least in part: taking it as a respectable but\nidle dream precludes the discussion of the possibility that the dream is\nnot utterly impracticable, that at least to some extent it is practicable\nunder certain circumstances. Of course, it may nevertheless be judged\nundesirable, at least as a plan to execute only in part and at a great cost.\nNevertheless, it is advisable to take s eriously the question, is the Post-\nmodern Vision desirable or not? This question is shelved too, and for the\nsame reason. The vision is treated as unserious. It is even resented when\nviewed as more than a mere fantasy whose whole function is strictly to\ninsure some anti-racist anti-colonialist sentiment, as well as some\nentertainment in the form of idle romances not in conflict with the\nWestern way of life (Crocodile Dundee).\nWhat is the source of this hostility to taking the Post-modern Vision as an\ninspiration for action? Why is it so obviously unthinkable that we should\nlive in a modern, highly technological, democratic, civilized society and\nyet have a high level of integration of our different functions? Are we so\nconvinced that the modern world must be atomized or regress? Is it\nattested that toying with magic systems in a high-brow fashion is\ndangerous? Why do we insist on the separation of different functions even\nwhen it is already demonstrably possible to merge or integrate some of\nthem? For, no doubt, it has been shown that learning, play and work need\nnot be as separated as they traditionally are in our society, that we can\nintegrate them--not ever fully, but to a large extent, in a manner more\ncharacteristic of magically-oriented societies, yet beneficially so by our\nown standards.\nThere is much opposition to any tendency to integrate our societies. For\nexample, there is little sympathy among educational theoreticians with\nthe Montessori educational system, which aims at some integration of\nlearning and play, and which is much more successful than the standard\neducational system. Another example is the movement for improvement\nof the quality of working life, or for industrial democracy. It stands for\nincreased training on the job, for job rotation, for organizing semi-\nautonomous worker teams and for similar means for the indefinite\nprolongation of worker education. There is a tremendous hostility to that\nmovement just because its major aim is to integrate work and education.\nWhat is the source of this hostility to simple attempts at integration? Why\nis this hostility particularly strong among the Post-moderns who mislabel\nthemselves Marxists?\nThe self-appointed defenders of Marx oppose all effort to improve present\nsociety short of going to the barricades. Their advocacy of a civil war in a\nrelatively peaceful and secure society is certainly much the greater\noffence then their opposition to this or that improvement of it (as\nimprovement reduces the likelihood of a revolution), whether\nimprovement in accord with the Romantic Vision or the Post-modern\nVision or otherwise. Nevertheless, their hostility to modern society gets\nparticularly virulent when it is directed against attempts at integrating it.\nTheir hostility is not to integration as such; on the contrary, and\nparadoxically, their hostility to any effort to integrate present society is\nfed by their endorsement of the Post-modern Vision: this vision gains\nrespectability on condition that it is not taken seriously and only as long\nas it is not taken seriously. This proviso precludes realistic efforts to\npursue integrative aims.\nTaking Integration Seriously.\nTaking integration seriously means, at the very least, doing so\nresponsibly --without populism and irrationality. Here comes a thesis that\nhas created much controversy, and I wish to dodge a part of the\ncontroversy. Karl Popper noted that one obvious way to avoid\nresponsibility is to go for the jackpot or for nothing. Speaking of social\nand political engineering (the terminology is that of John Dewey) he\ndistinguished between a total or utopian engineering and partial or\npiecemeal one; and he recommended the latter, as the former is\nirresponsible (The Open Society and Its Enemies, passim .). Since he did\nnot mean by piecemeal small-scale, and since today some total, non-\nutopian plans to save our planet are urgently required, it is better to\navoid distraction into the controversy about how irresponsible utopian\nengineering in general is. Suffice it if it is admitted that Popper has scored\nagainst the irresponsible revolutionaries who advocate revolutions even if\nthese are avoidable. It would then be also admitted that little chance to\ngo to the barricades just now, it is irresponsible to insist on the choice\nbetween the barricades and inaction. Perhaps Walter Kaufmann's\ncharacterization of this recommendation as a decidophobic strategy is\ncorrect. It is not the whole truth, as some irresponsible individuals are\nmore trigger-happy than decidophobic; yet, in the present context they\nare better ignored.\nThe idea that Romantic ends are better not treated as plans is an\nadmission that they can be pursued only Romantically. And the Marxists\nreject the idea that these ends can be pursued responsibly, that they can\ninspire programs that may be attempted by critically-minded realists. And\nthose who respect the hankering after the integration of pre-literate\nsociety on the condition that the hankering is not critically debated are\nmerely following the Marxist practice of inaction.\nThis is a special case of a general point made decades ago by I.C. Jarvie,\nwhich has aroused no comment in the literature: every dream may be\ndreamt as an excuse for insistent inaction and yet it may nevertheless\nalso constitute an inspiration for a plan. (See his &#34;Utopia and the\nArchitect&#34;, in our Rationality: The Critical View.)\nAccordingly, it is worth pursuing the aim of the Post-modern Vision, the\naim of planning an integrated, coherent, progressive society. Let us\nassume, then, that the hostility to genuine pursuit of integration,\nregrettably so common in our society, is rooted in some error or another\nand so need not be studied just now. (It will invite study as parts of some\nconcrete proposals, so as to counter the hostility with appropriate\narguments and with compensation for those whose interests will be hurt\nby the implementation of these concrete proposals.) How can we go about\nit? Before we can discuss this, we have to glance at the causes of\nintegration and separation.\nThe discussion here is not an attempt to defend any specific concrete\nprogram for partial integration. There are such programs, and some of\nthem were mentioned earlier, especially the partial integration of study\nand play or study and work (not to exclude the partial integration of work\nand play). The point mentioned here is advisably general: there is a\ntraditional hostility to the mixture of work and play (in the name of\ndiscipline), for example, and there is a traditional proposal that atomizing\nsociety is for the good, that excessive division of labor (Taylorism) is\nexcellent for many reasons, and so on. Without going into detail, we may\nobserve that, as in all matters, the truth may go hither and thither, and\nso there is an understandable hankering for integration that deserves\nstudy--for both theoretical and practical purposes. Even the hostility to\nintegration as magically oriented deserves study. Let me then discuss\nmagic, since many scientifically -oriented writers, such as Gellner, agree\nthat integration is historically rooted in magic.\nBetween Religion and Magic\nWhy is magic integrated and religion not? The question deserves a better\nformulation, since, evidently, we have integrated and atomized cases of\nboth magic and religion. For, magic is integrated in pre -literate societies\nand atomized in industrial societies in which it appears. (In our\nRationality: The Critical View, Jarvie and I have argued empirically that\nwe know of no magic -free society; Gellner is amused by our\nincomprehension of the view of a cucumber as an ox to be carved coupled\nwith our acceptance of the wafer as the flesh of Christ to be cannibalized.)\nAnd religion is atomized in modern society because modern society is\natomized (on which more soon), but it is highly integrated in the\nrelatively pre-literate societies of Medieval Europe (as our Romantic\nhistorians keep reminding us) and to some extent even of contemporary,\nstill pre-industrialized pockets of Europe. So the question is, why is\nindustrial society so atomized, at least by comparison to pre-\nindustrialized, especially pre-literate, societies in general? This takes us\naway from the fact that most pre -industrialized societies are primitive and\nthat primitive societies are governed more by magic than by religion,\nwhere magic is viewed as a combination of magic rites with an animist-\nfetishist religion of sorts, and that magic is more prevalent in pre -\nindustrial than in industrial societies.\nPerhaps the question is still misplaced. Perhaps it is not industrialization\nbut, as Gellner observes, literacy, or education in general, or s cientific\neducation in particular, that causes the frightfully isolated individuals; so\nmuch so, that it was surprising for many social scientists to learn about\ncertain strong social ties there. It is not easy, then, to assess its degree of\nintegration, b ut it clearly is low in the sense that it harbors so much\nloneliness; yet it may and often does remain magic -ridden, despite the\nfact that its vicinity to industry makes it prey to missionary influences so\nthat it usually is Christianized. Voodoo, that paradigm of magic within\nChristianity, is indigenous to typically slum society.\nThis leads to the question, though, is there something in magic that\nmakes it a good social glue? Is magic, because of its animism and\nfetishism, a specifically integrating characteristic of its society? Despite\nour rejection of Voodoo, may we approve of its integrative aspect and\ndeclare that its practitioners are more integrated under its influence than\nthey are after they lose it? This question is seldom asked, because of the\ninterference of the Post-modern Vision. This is but one example of the\nfact that this vision is less innocuous than it seems. Indeed, the benefits\nof research into questions that it blocks can scarcely be assessed; in my\nopinion, the loss is great.\nThe question, then, is, how does magic act as a social glue?\nThis question received an answer from anthropologists, especially from\nthose under the influence of the British school It is very clear, even\nthough I do not think this fact has been noticed before sufficiently\ncritically: their answer is, magic is more integrative than religion, because\nthe former is much more directly related to the empirical world than the\nlatter.\nHow, then, can magicians hold an obviously false view of the world and\nkeep it integrated with their empirical experience? This question has two\ntraditional answers: the Bacon-Frazer answer and the Durkheim answer.\nBoth require some background explanation, I am afraid. The Durkheim\nanswer is easier to present: it is well within the sociology of knowledge,\nwhereas the Bacon-Frazer is within the psychology of science.\nBacon and Frazer on Magic as Pseudo -science.\nThe Bacon-Frazer answer is based on two classic discoveries of Sir Francis\nBacon, the one that we refuse to accept empirical refutations of our\npreconceived notions, and the other that we constrain the meanings of\nterms we use in order to escape these refutations. Both of these\ndiscoveries are significant and they are rediscovered repeatedly and\nattributed to diverse thinkers, though they are clearly and forcefully\nstated in Bacon's immensely influential Novum Organum, (1620).\nBacon lived in Elizabethan society, a society permeated with both magic\nand religion. He took it for granted that magic as he knew it, as well as\nreligion as he knew it, were sets of dogmas, prejudices and superstitions.\nFor, he proposed that any hypothesis one entertains long enough\nbecomes all three: a dogma, a superstition and a prejudice. He did think\nmagic was possible, in the sense that many wondrous claims of\nmagicians, to do with the transmutations of metals, with wonder cures\nand with longevity, are lies, but they can be approached scientifically and\nrendered successful. (He reported observations of magical cures.) As to\nreligion, he did think that (since it is not science) of necessity it is\ndogmatic, and so he preferred its claims to be utterly non-factual.\nIn Bacon's view, in short, magic is pseudo-science. Bacon considered\nalmost all extant intellectual activity spurious: university scholars are\nengaged in endless, ridiculous disputations. They did so because, he said,\ntheir views are refuted by empirical observations; and, quite generally,\nrefuted errors are not rejected as they should be. This theory led him to\nsuggest the varieties of ways in which apologetic thinkers argue. One of\nthese is particularly sophisticated: the false theories undergo change:\nthey have their scope narrowed so as to exclude the refuting instances as\nirrelevant to them; the narrowing of scope is done either by altering the\nintended scope explicitly, or, more often, covertly, by the narrowing of\nthe meaning of the terms used to state them. (Karl Popper called this\nmove the conventionalist twist and surreptitious change; Imre Lakatos\ncalled it monster-barring and concept-shrinking.)\nFrazer, together with most thinkers, accepted all this as a magic emptied\nof its contents. He therefore declared religion inferior to magic, as it is a\nstep in the wrong direction the way Bacon described it: the retraction of\nmeaning instead of the re linquishing of error. (The evolutionist aspect of\nthis theory will explain why magic is ancient in origin, religion its newer\nreplacement. This is highly seductive, until articulated, and then it\nbecomes clear that this is just the Post-modern Vision. Magic rites are\nextremely hardy and prevalent in all pre-industrial societies and in many\nindustrial ones, whereas Christianity absorbed the animism-fetishism of\npre-Christian Europe to a surprisingly large extent. Ironically, this last\npoint about the surviva l of animism-fetishist faith and of magic rites in\nEuropean Christendom is the very point extensively and excitingly\nillustrated in Frazer's The Golden Bough.)\nThe Bacon-Frazer theory, that refutation of the factual claims of religion\nempties it of its factual content, is extremely popular. (Its latest growth is\nGellner's elaboration of Russell's view of communism as a religion: Gellner\nproposes ( Thought and Change) that Marxism was emptied of all factual\ncontent as a result of clashes between theory and facts. This is a bit\nharder on Marxism than on Christianity, where the counsel, Render unto\nCaesar what is Caesar's is replaced by the Praxis Theory of the Unity of\nTheory and Practice.) This is quite remarkable in view of the fact that the\ntheory in question is a psychological view of magic and of religion,\naccording to which both are mere matters of opinion, and inferior\ncompetitors to science at that. (Taking science as the body of true,\ndemonstrated opinion, or even as merely the best opinion around, one\ncannot but see them as ousted by science and their adherents therefore\nas the rear-guard. Feyerabend's just complaint is rooted in this fact.)\nThe Bacon-Frazer theory of religion and magic has been ousted by a more\nsophisticated, positivist, institutional theory of magic and of religion,\nwhich is better, though also quite inadequate (as shown in detail by\nGellner, in his Cause and meaning in the Social Sciences, Chapter 6, as\nwell as by Jarvie, in his The Revolution in Anthropology ). It is inadequate\nin that it altogether ignores all doctrines as opinions. (This inadequacy\nindicates that Gellner is groping for a third theory that includes elements\nfrom the two traditional ones; indeed, it calls for a theory of\ninstitutionalized opinions proper, a theory I have suggested an outline of\nin my Towards a Rational Philosophical Anthropology .)\nDurkheim on Religion and Magic.\nThe most influential variant of the positivist theory is that of Durkheim.\nDurkheim answered the question how do religion and magic act as social\nglue? His answer began with the acceptance as a matter of course of the\nBaconian thesis that taken literally religion either has no empirical content\nor it is bunk: it is mere superstition and prejudice. The true meaning of\nreligion (magic included), then, is not literal but metaphorical: it is society\nextolling itself. (This theory of Durkheim is a variant of what Friedrich\nNietzsche warned against under the title of &#34;secular religion'.) (All\nphilosophers who sanctify ordinary language, and who have incurred the\nwrath of Russell, Popper and Gellner, take this theory for granted when\nthey notice the prevalence of religious contentions in everyday discourse.)\nDurkheim's disciples have admitted that his theory has been most\nuncomfortably confirmed by the advent of Fascism and Nazism (see\nStephen Lukes' scholarly monograph, Emile Durkheim ). Yet, the critic of\nthis doctrine has to take account of the fact that in his wisdom Durkheim\nclearly stated that religion is more integrative than magic. Admittedly,\nthis same fact is usually overlooked by Durkheim's disciples, and with\nsome justice. When he declared religion more integrative than magic he\nwas not reporting any empirical observation. He was conveying a vision of\na highly integrated society, as described, say, at the end of his classic The\nDivision of Labor in Society and a faith in progress of sorts.\nHis view of the extreme division of labor (on which more soon) as\nintegrative shows him mistaken and/or having a different view of\nintegration than is commonly held. And so, disciple and critic of Durkheim\nalike should return to the question, of magic and religion, which is more\nintegrative?\nFor, the question, &#34;is pre-literate society more integrated than industrial\nsociety?', is clearly answered in an empirical manner. The better\nintegration is claimed to have been observed repeatedly. Rightly or\nwrongly, it is claimed that pre-literate people cannot differentiate religion,\npolitics, economics, ritual, the best candidate for the status of the true\nexplanation is that it is magic that does it. This holds only if magic is more\nintegrative than religion, of course.\nWhy? What is the difference between religion and magic? The positivist\ntheory takes both magic and religion to be not opinions at all but rites\n(inc luding the ritual reciting of the official doctrine), and rites with some\nsymbolic social significance. It is but an elaboration of the theory of\nDurkheim of religion as a social glue, without his claim that magic is\ninferior to religion. But then both magic and religion are presented--or\nrather should be presented (but its advocates are disingenuous, says\nJarvie)--as of equal status: the question we have asked about the\ndifference between magic and religion receives the denial of its\npresupposition: there is no difference.\nIs there then at least a difference between degrees of integration that\nmagic and religion offer? Yes; and this depends on the division of labor in\nsociety, since pre -literate society is dominated by magic and has a coarse\ndivision of labor. True or false, this is a move back to Durkheim all the\nway: we do not know where to stop. And then we have swallowed\nDurkheim's view that religion is more integrative, whereas according to\nhis positivist disciples magic is (so that possibly the Post-modern Vision is\nnowadays more a part of social anthropology and the loveliness of remote\npre-literate tribes rather than of political theory and a Reactionary\npretense of a return to our own lovely folkways). Moreover, Durkheim\n(and his collaborator Mauss ) feared that we must include as social glue,\nnot only magic and religion, but also science: is science too, they asked\n(end of Primitive Classification), a mere matter of ritual? Hopefully not,\nthey said.\nDurkheim's followers among the anthropologists do not raise his question\nconcerning the status of science. His followers among the sociologists,\nhowever, do. Some of them are true Romantics; they play anthropologists\nand say, &#34;Yes: science, too, is a (magic) ritual&#34;. Some of these Romantics\nstill endorse the claim of science to truth: it is both a ritual and a valid\nopinion. Others stick to the ritual: science has no exclusive right to be the\ntrue opinion; no more than magic. Of course, the former have an over-\ndetermination on their hands (i.e., too many sufficient causes cooperating\nin harmony), the others have the success of industrial society to make\nscience a particularly potent magic.\nBe it so. Is industrial society better integrated than pre -literate society,\nthough? Durkheim said, yes. The Post-modern Vision says, no. Assume\nthat vision, and Durkheim is out. Elaborate on the argument in favor of\nthat vision, and Durkheim slips in. We are stuck.\nThe confusion is very interesting, and was pointed out, as far as I know,\nonly by Bertrand Russell, in his Science and Society. Technologically,\nprimitive society has its household provide most of its necessities and so\nthe individual is more integrated, whereas pre-literate society is more\natomized in comparison to technological society, since the latter enjo ys a\nhigher degree of division of labor and is therefore more integrated \u2014 at\nthe expense of its members being less economically integrated. Moreover,\nwe see here that economic dependence and moral dependence appear as\nopposites of sorts: members of pre -literate society have more of the one,\nmembers of civilized society have more of the other. Here, incidentally,\nRussell is making use of Georg Simmel's theory of the web of affiliation. It\nis also akin to Simmel's in that it neither reduces the individual to society\nnor society to the individual, since it views the integration of the standard\nindividual as different from that of the society as a whole; it is thus\nsystemic (ascribing to systems and to its members different\ncharacteristics).\nWhy is Industrial Society so Atomized?\nIn which manner is industrial society less integrated than pre -literate\nsociety? This question is at the heart of the discussion and it is\nunavoidable; it is usually avoided due to the Post-modern Vision, which is\nfuzzy; and then the d iscussion on it, when at all attempted, becomes\nequally fuzzy. The answer that can be given the status of an observation\nreport is that in modern industrial society activities are fragmented or\ncompartmentalized, so that members of such a society, even if quite\nuneducated, can pre-literate society can hardly do so or even notice the\ndistinction between the different activities. And religious thinkers have\nalways looked with awe at people who consider themselves engaged in\nthe worship of God no matter what activity holds their attention in\naddition to that. Moreover, the fragmentation or compartmentalization\nobserved in any situation whatsoever is but a matter of degree, and its\nhigh degree is not a matter of industrialization or civilization but of the\npuritanical ethos that has traditionally gone with the industrial or modern\nethos.\nThe early Romantic philosophers who put great value on the integration\nthat was later observed in pre-literate society, took for granted that\nindividuals who live in a more integrated life-style are more at peace,\nmore economically autonomous, belong to a more stable and integrated\nsociety, and so on. They are allegedly in a better position in all respects\nexcept science and technology. The distinction between culture and\nciviliz ation was introduced by somewhat Romantic writers in various\nways, but always as a means to suggest that in matters of culture the\nuncivilized is superior to the civilized. This has made it difficult for these\nthinkers to say what exactly culture is; it made their writings difficult and\nso deep; in brief they hoodwinked their readers.\nThis leads naturally to a group of questions about modern society,\nespecially whether modern society is necessarily industrial, rather than\ntechnologically advanced, and whether it is necessarily, or at all,\npuritanical, rather than hedonistic. The classical answer is Marx's\ntechnological determinism, so-called: history had to progress, if at all,\nmore or less according to the observed scheme; in particular,\nindustrialization is the only path to modernization. It seems that\nincreasing number of thinkers now break increasingly further away from\ntechnological determinism. They find it not difficult at all to imagine a\nsociety that is technologically advanced, yet not industrial in the sense in\nwhich Karl Marx or Alfred Marshall described the major traits of trade and\nindustry (as large-scale production process utilizing hired labor at the\nmachine's controls and trading its products in relatively free markets). As\nto the question of Puritanism, the situation is still controversial.\nThe debate now rages between the school which views science as\npuritanical (Max Weber and Robert K. Merton if not Immanuel Kant) and\nthe school that views science as hedonistic (chiefly Lewis Feuer, if not\nDavid Hume and Adam Smith). The dispute seems to be rather vague.\nAfter all (as we learn from Bronislaw Malinowski if not from Karl Marx), a\ntradition can advocate conflicting views, or profess the one and practice\nthe other. Marx claimed that the pilla rs of society in his day professed\nwater and drank wine. More likely (as Heinrich Heine so astutely\nobserved), they professed to be hedonist and behaved systematically in a\npuritan manner.\nThere is even a classic hedonist excuse for the systematic adoptio n of\npuritan conduct: it is known as deferred gratification: the hedonists who\ndo not enjoy what they might enjoy may claim that the enjoyment is all\nthe greater when postponed, and then it is postponed indefinitely till it is\ntoo late.\nAnd so, the prime hypothesis for the atomization or fragmentation or\ncompartmentalization of modern society is this. The cause of\nfragmentation is only indirectly industry or modernity. It came with the\nmodern lifestyle in a package deal (Gellner, P lough, Sword and Book,, p.\n103). The package can now be disentangled. We may then choose from\nthe packet what we like, and we may declare, if we wish, that increased\nintegration of one sort or another should play the role of a criterion of\nchoice. But we may also use a different c riterion, and even if we choose\nthis criterion, the outcome is not uniquely determined thereby, at least\nnot as long as we go for increased integration, not for total integration.\nThe package deal was a complex matter. Even on the question of\nintegration and fragmentation it offered a complex alteration. As was\nmentioned already, the economic autonomy had to give way to moral\nautonomy. Moreover, as Gellner notices (Nations and Nationalism), ethical\nattitudes within integrated societies are always complex due to the very\nintegration of the group: there were always multiple sets of rights and\nduties between two members; yet relations with strangers had to be\nhighly simplified and each side of a transaction had to prove its reliability.\nNow this attitude required deference both to traditional religion and to the\nfacts of science, thereby imposing a separation between religion and\nscience. It was the &#34;mixing&#34; of religion and science that Sir Francis Bacon\nso vociferously blamed for so many of our ills. He thus viewed\ncompartmentalization as the cost of modernization; and he was in error--\nat least if we are allowed to choose a religion that may very well go\nwith science.\nDeconstructing the Package Deal of Industrialism\nThe package deal required an attitude of utter and complete personal\nautonomy which was then taken over by the early Romantic philosophers\nas the vision of the Hero: only a saint or a genius or an otherwise\nexceptional person can be truly autonomous in the sense of the\nphilosophers of the scientif ic and industrial revolution. This led to re-\nenchantment, to use the term of Max Weber and Ernest Gellner, and then\nthe hedonists had to hide behind the theory of deferred gratification, or\nbehind any other flimsy excuses for conventional conduct, in order to\nendorse harsh, puritanical mode of education and lifestyle, harsh\n&#34;capitalist&#34; attitudes to workers as lazy, and so on.\nThe question will arise at once, how much can one separate the items in\nthe package deal? Moreover, what will be the cost of giving up some\nitems in it?\nHere Gellner's philosophy comes as a straight answer. On the one hand,\non his view science and technology are inseparable (not in the sense that\nwe cannot imagine a society with science and yet without scientific\ntechnology; this has been proposed in Samuel Butler's Erewhon; rather\nthey are inseparable in that Erewhonian society is not likely). On the\nother hand they are separated from almost every social institution,\nespecially those belonging to alternative ways of life, more sophisticated\nor less so: there is a Great Divide between science and all else. Moreover,\nthought and change are interwoven. In particular, &#34;the growth of\nknowledge forces a &#34;trans-valuation of values&#34; whether we like it or not&#34;\n(Gellner, Thought and Change, p.217).\nIt is this transition that he deems essential, the crossing of the Great\nDivide, from the traditional (pre-literate or literate) ways of life and\nvalues to modern, science-and-technology-based ones.\nWe still face the question raised here: what do we have to give up in\norder to overcome the Small Divide between integrated and atomized or\nfragmented or compartmentalized society? What can be done in order to\nrender our societies increasingly integrated, though not necessarily in the\nsame manner everywhere?\nThe first answer is autonomy: we have to educate the citizen to be able to\nchoose and to exercise choice freely. The great modern division between\nphilosophers, social thinkers, authors, political leaders and so on, is that\nbetween those who advocate autonomy and those who oppose it. All else\nis secondary. Customarily, the advocates of autonomy see autonomy as\nnatural and as easy, and their opponents oppose autonomy on the ground\nthat it is an impossible burden. One of the great insights of Karl Popper\n(The Open Society and Its Enemies) is that attitudes for and against\nautonomy signify more than assessment of the ease or difficulty of its\nimitation: the valuation of autonomy as an important asset will bring\nabout the search for ways to implement it with as much ease as possible.\nThe ones who oppose such experiments are ones who value social\nstability over against autonomy.\nCome to think of it, the same holds for social stability. It is hostility to\nautonomy that supports the view that widespread autono my risks social\nstability and that it thus risks the very existence of society. This may be\ntrue, but it is stated not as an empirical observation, not even as a well-\ntested theory: it is stated as an excuse for the hostility to the proposal to\neducate the average citizen towards autonomy. Now the theory may be\ntrue even if it is an untested excuse: we may want to test it. More likely,\nit may easily transpire that the excuse is correct only under given\nconditions, usually very primitive ones, and that accepting the excuse as\na general truth supports insistence on the demand not to deviate too\nmuch from traditional society, as does the Romantic Vision.\nThe question, then, is, what should we replace technological determinism\nwith? What are the options of tilting history's course this or that way and\nwhat is the preferred option? The answer is pluralistic, and in a\nmultiplicity of ways.\nIn particular, the reason religion is so remote, if there is any truth to the\nBacon-Frazer theory, is not so much that we rescue it as we do, but that\nwe take it to play a sensitive role as a social glue ` la Durkheim and so\ndare not revolutionize our view of it. This can be easily seen when mystic\nreligion and established religion are compared: it is established religion,\nas established, that is so remote from daily life in the modern world.\nIf so, and if social stability is deemed less important then tradition\neverywhere claims, then the future of religion is wide open, and so is the\nfuture of any factor, integrative or atomizing. The choice as to how\nintegrated our society should be, then, is not the choice between\ncivilization and culture, but of the way we prepare our package deal. We\nmay therefore institute a variety of experiments in devising social glues of\ndiverse sorts. We may then find that the main question is, do we really\nneed social stability, and if not, do we really want it and at what price?\nIt is the question of price that makes the difference between the\nresponsible and the irresponsible program--or between the program and\nthe enjoyable harmless myth. Myths are at least indicative of what we\nwould like to have were the price right. This explains the success of some\ncardboard popular heroes as compared with others. And on the basis of\nthis contention we may bring the latest popular cardboard hero, Crocodile\nDundee as a witness for our deep wishes. Though there are only two\nmovies about him. it is clear what has caught the fancy of vast crowds on\nmany continents. Crocodile Dundee is a westerner, not a Westerner like\nyou and me, but like any western hero. He also is at home in the\nAustralian bush. He does not move in the bush like a hero in an ordeal:\nwestern mythology, including many that have been created for the silver\nscreen, are full of ordeal in primitive terrain of all sorts. Dundee is\ndifferent. The bush is his home--his second home, no doubt, but that\nmatters little. He has friends in the bush, who are at home in the civilized\nworld: it is their second home. There is no hint that primitive culture and\nmagic a re exempt from criticism, and they are certainly not presented in\na relativist fashion as equal to western science. But the image is\nsuggested that there are valuable and reprehensible aspects to each\nsociety, that one can move freely from one to another with a little human\nunderstanding, that a sense of proportion does a lot to bridge gaps. More\none cannot possibly ascribe even to serious movies, let alone to trash.\nAnd trash these movies certainly are, as there is not even a glance at the\nproblems raised in these movies. They are mere pastime, they entertain.\nThey could not be found that entertaining were they not able to tickle our\nfancy the right way, even if only as a mild joke. The Post-modern vision\nmay be vulgar, but it presents a strong yearning.\n")

This may invite criticism of the conduct of the\nancient leadership, which, as always, is questionable and useless.\nRather, an open discussion should be instituted on the proposal to\nmake future changes openly, not surreptitiously; particularly the\nchange from surreptitious changes to open changes is better done\nopenly.\nHalakha and Agada\nBy Joseph Agassi\nTel-Aviv University and York University, Toronto\n1. Jewish Studies and Rabbinic Studies\nThe modern field of Jewish Studies was inaugurated by Leopold\nZunz early in the nineteenth century, as a historical survey of\nJewish literature in the broadest sense, including Jewish Law,\ncommentaries, liturgy, philosophy, etc. He left his stamp on the\nfield to date, both in the breadth and scope of the subject and in\nits character. As to the breadth and scope, even his own work,\nrelatively slender and sketchy as it was, is simply unbelievably\nhuge. These days the requirements from a scholar in this field are\nstaggering; to be taken seriously in it one needs a few\nqualifications, each of which requires a lifetime of devotion to\nscholarship. First, the major required competence is in Jewish\nLaw-to the degree attainable only by constant exposure to it from\nearly childhood (see Lieberman, 1974, p. 92; Lieberman takes\nrelish, it seems, in showing that even the leading Jewish historian\nFritz Baer was not up to this). Second, one must be a philologist\nat home in the classics, able to compare Hebrew, Greek and Latin\ntexts, translations, common expressions, legal terminologies,\ninscriptions, amulets, and more. Third, one must be proficient in\na few ancient Semitic languages and dialects. Fourth, one must be\nfamiliar with the swelling secondary literatures in diverse modern\nlanguages from the writings of Zunz onward. Fifth, one has to be\nfamiliar with Church history, the works of the Church Fathers,\nCanon Law and Church rites. Sixth and finally, one has to exhibit\nsufficient command of world history, political, social and\ncultural, as well as of snippets of archeology, art history and\nwhatever else may turn up as relevant to one or another item under\nscrutiny. It is clear that only few individuals qualify, and they\nform an elite club like the world's greatest artistic virtuosi.\nThe disadvantage of such elitism is that the elite can play\nwith ideas beyond the comprehension, let alone the critical\nappraisal, of ignorant outsider like the writer of these lines.\nYet as their labors signify for us ignoramuses, we must do our\nmiserable best to comprehend the methods, general criteria and\nunderlying principles involved in their awesome researches, as well\nas their major conclusions.\nRemarkably, Zunz has laid the ground rules in this respect\nwithout ever specifying them and that with some minor corrections\nand extensions his rulings still stand, no matter how much the\nimage of the different historical items that he had studied was\naltered as the field has progressed. (See * Encyclopedia\nJudaica*, Art. Zunz; see preface to Hebrew translation of his\nwork for a more detailed, accurate and sympathetic presentation.)\nAs noted, the field of Jewish Studies embraces Rabbinical\nStudies with the exception that, as such, its practitioners do not\nqualify as rabbinical authorities, and it is not clear what impact\nthey do have on Jewish public life. However much admiration was\naccorded Zunz and his followers (he had no disciples), the impact\nthey had on Jewish tradition, on Jewish practices, etc. are\nprobably minor. (Even the Jewish communities of the conservative\nand reform persuasions evolved more under the pressure of\ncircumstances than following Jewish Studies, simply because\nsystematically ignored as much as possible.) Zunz himself was\nactive in Jewish affairs, and his activities were readily colored\nby his views of Jewish history. Yet they were vague: he wrote on\nthe Jews in a mixed mode-partly as a modern (sub)culture, partly as\na nation in the ancient sense of the word and even in the modern\nsense. Yet he found unproblematic and fully justified his demand\nfor full emancipation for the Jews of Prussia. This, however, was\noutside the domain of Rabbinic Studies, especially since the really\northodox rabbis did not welcome emancipation (See Graetz ***) and\nothers took for granted the separation of national and communal\naffairs in the spirit of the modern world. (This hardly needs\nmention, but for the disastrous identification in contemporary\nIsrael of the nation with the orthodox community- in the face of the\nfacts that of the nation one fifth are non-Jews and only a minority\nare religiously observant.)\nApart from Rabbinical Studies proper, there is little in Jewish\nStudies of interest to the genuinely orthodox-except for some\nchronology, some philology and occasional restorations of some\ncorrupt texts; since these studies are readily in the critical\nscientific spirit and thus free of religious postulates, orthodox\nRabbinical scholars tend to ignore them.\nThis is not to say that the tradition of Jewish Studies is\nhostile to religion or to orthodoxy in the wake of Spinoza. He was\nan apostate; he flatly rejected Jewish ritual as magical and\nsuperstitious and so he was anathema. No doubt, there were two\nimportant precedents to Spinoza's conduct that met with some\nmeasure of tolerance. First, the great Maimonides (ca. 13th c.\nAD), it is well-known, rejected animal sacrifices as superstitious.\nBut then this ritual was already cancelled anyway. Moreover, he\nwas not utterly exempt from severe censure-on account of that and\non account of his readiness to reinterpret Scriptures in line with\nhis philosophy. But it is generally agreed that it is the\nrejection of rituals that matters much more than reinterpretation,\nand that even though Maimonides is possibly forgiven, this is no\nlicense for lesser mortals. Second was the Old Testament criticism\nof Ebenezer (ca 12th c). Yet he, like most critics in late\nAntiquity and the Middle Ages, did not take his criticism as\nconclusive in any way, but, on the contrary, he considered it a\nchallenge to improve his own understanding of the holy texts. This\nis the major difference between the traditionalist and the\ncritical, scientific attitude to criticism, as stressed by a number\nof leading scholars, Harry A. Wolfson and Shlomo Pines being the\nmost prominent among them; whereas the traditionalist finds in\ncriticism a defect in the critic's understanding which requires a\nreturn to the pure sources, the critical finds it devastating and\nrequiring corrections, new readings and new ideas. Thus, says\nWolfson (1929, p. ), the criticisms which Al- Ghazali (ca 11th c.)\nlaunched against Aristotle were taken from Averroes (ca * c.), but\nthe earlier writer did not take it as finding faults in Aristotle's\ntexts, only the later did. The conservative attitude is the\nprevalent one, and it persevered for a long time. Thus, not only\ndid St. Thomas find it necessary to compromise the physics of\nAristotle and Archimedes, thus making a mess of things, but also,\nwhen in Galileo's famous dialogue of the early seventeenth century\nabout astronomy the Aristotelian interlocutor in it is made to\nadmit a criticism of Aristotle's physics, he does not conclude that\nAristotle's physics is to be overthrown, and a long methodological\ndebate about intellectual autonomy is offered as means to make such\na drastic change. (See the famous study of Dijksterhuis, 1965,\nwhere both Thomas' compromise and the later contrast between\nAristotle and Archimedes are praised. So much for the alleged\nprevalence of the scientific critical attitude among historians of\nscience.)\nWe face a problem here: do Jewish Studies allow some ritually\nforbidden criticism, namely, public criticism of rituals, and if so\nis this conducive to ritual reform? On this, too, Zunz had an\nopinion: his criticism was as inoffensive as he could make it and\nscarcely ever of rituals, and though he did favor reforms, he\nconsidered only marginal ones, and on the strict condition that\nthey do not threaten Jewish unity. Otherwise he preferred\ncompromise or even submissiveness. Later writers simply refused to\ncomment on the matter of ritual and stuck to discussion of matters\nof doctrine and of history. Yet here is a question concerning\ndoctrine which is of great ritual significance: how much dissent\nfrom established doctrine is it permitted to express- in private\nand/or in public?\nThis is an open question, on which there is an extensive\nview that dissent may be tolerated in private but not in public.\nNor is it peculiar to Judaism: in a few modern societies in which\nmagic rituals are alive, such as in the less developed parts of\nSouthern Europe, faith in magic is not required but the public\nexpression of its rejection is not tolerated. Much of the\nMediaeval literature is read this way. Much of today's literature\non the ideas and opinions of Maimonides, the greatest Rabbinic\nlegislator and Jewish philosopher of all commentators since Rabbi\nJuda the President (ca. 2nd c AD) rests on the supposition that he\nintentionally confused his untutored reader as he intended to hint\nat heresies in a language comprehensible only to the adept. This\nis not the place to express my reservations on this reading of\nMaimonides, (see my 1983); the fact that this is a view with some\ncurrency suffices to exp lain the situation in the field. The\ngeneral attitude is scientific, and so not tolerant of superstition\nin any way other than the one exhibited by most anthropologists and\nhistorians of culture. (See Lieberman, 1974, p. 135:\nNonsense is nonsense, but the history of nonsense is a very\nimportant science. In certain respects it is more revealing\nthan the history of science based on reason.\nThis quote is revealing about Lieberman's views, say, about magic\nin the Old Testament.) As much as possible, the literature on\nJewish Studies ignores the critique of religion *a\nla* Spinoza; few recognized contributors to the field are\neven half as defiant as he was. (As to contributors to Jewish\nStudies who are of Conservative communities, they either keep their\ndissent from orthodoxy separate from their scholarship or risk\ntheir membership in the scholarly elite club.) Now submissiveness\nis not quite possible, as textual analysis of the Old Testament is\nbased on the heretic assumptions that some of its texts are\ncorrupted, and that they were all authored, compiled and edited, so\nthat even if each of them is the output of one author, its extant\nversion is not. Moreover, in the effort at the reconstruction of\nan * urtext*, conjectures may be surmised about the\ndiverse (possibly conflicting) problem-situations of its author(s),\ncompilers and editors. But this cannot be helped, except by\nseparating Jewish Studies from Old Testament scholarship. The\nseparation is generally endorsed. Old Testament Studies still\nabide by the understanding that heresies do not impinge on ritual\npractices one way or another, but otherwise they are governed by\ndifferent, slightly more critical rules: they permit the statement\nof heresy, though as inoffensively as possible, and while mitigated\nby minimizing it and by stressing acceptable orthodox views,\nespecially overall orthodox readings of the ancient texts and their\noverall gists, so that what is lost by tempering with the sacred\ntexts is partly recovered by expressed reverence.\nWhat is shared by Jewish Studies and Old Testament Studies are\nnot only the conciliatory attitude and deference to orthodoxy and\nthe to taboo on criticism of all rituals; also, rituals are made by\nall critically- minded scholars of both fields to appear as\nmeaningless as possible, so as to denude them of all possible\nmagical contents-even when their original sense looks suspiciously\nmagical.\nIt is not clear how much this is possible. Both Emile\nDurkheim and Sir James Frazer distinguished clearly between magic\nand religion, and even though their views are (dissimilar and)\nquestionable, they somehow bear the stamp of scientific authority\nor at least of scientific respectability, and this may suffice for\nthose active in Jewish and Old Testament Studies as an excuse for\nthe intent not to join Spinoza, especially in Jewish Studies which\nare kept clear of Old Testament studies. Indeed, the maxim\nproposed by Harry A. Wolfson is the full justification of the\nabstention from criticism of the Old Testament while engaging in\nJewish Studies: Wolfson takes the Renaissance metaphor of the Two\nBooks to its extreme: there are two ways of schooling in the ways\nof the Lord, the reading of the Two Books, and both readings are\ndone hypothetico-deductively: hypotheses are generated and tested\nagainst texts from this Book or that. (Wolfson's opinion of\nreligious studies as hypothetico-deductive, is apologetic: science\nis not only hypothetico-deductive, it is also ready to undergo\nrevolutions, if need be, that religious studies forbid, as he\nhimself has noted when recognizing the great shift that Al-Ghazali\neffected when he shifted the studies of Aristotle's texts away from\nthe sacrosanct religious sphere.) The discussion may be mere\nniceties, what is a fixture is simple: the tacit presupposition of\nJewish Studies with almost no exception is that this field sustains\nthe exclusion of both the Old Testament texts and the Law or the\nRitual as unconditionally as possible off limits, namely beyond\ncriticism-perhaps not in principle, but allegedly and tacitly as\nirrelevant to the field. Let us look at this second exclusion\nfirst, as it largely rests on the first exclusion as well as on\nJewish tradition that says, **one does not query an edict on\nthe basis of a report**.\n(* The terms used here systematically as translations of\nthe ancient term &#34;halakha&#34; and &#34;hagada&#34; or &#34;Agada&#34; will be &#34;edict&#34;\nand &#34;report&#34; respectively*.)\n2. Edicts and Reports\nIn his * magnum opus*, on Jewish commentaries, Zunz\ndeclares all literature past the Old Testament (and even some of\nthe latest parts of the Old Testament) to be commentary or exegesis\n[medrash]. (This, incidentally, is true only in a very loose\nsense: what Jewish text is called a commentary proper [medrash]\nand what not is at least in part a matter of tradition rather than\nan inherent quality. One intriguing scholar, Jacob Neusner, came\nup with the radical thesis that the texts known as commentaries\n[medrashim] are in dissent from the main Talmudic text [mishna]\nthat is presented defiantly not as commentaries on Scriptures.\nNeedless to say, his opinion is taken as more of a oddity than a\nserious thesis, though it has a very interesting kernel that may\nindeed be true: the general assumption that each major trend in\nJudaism exhibits one essential, consistent attitude, is untenable,\nnot only because different texts may exhibit different and even\nconflicting concerns, but also because attention must be given to\nthe interesting and powerful theories of both Alexandre Kojeve and\nClaude Levi-Strauss about myths as basically inconsistent.)\nAfter three introductory chapters of Zunz' text, the opening of\nhis fourth chapter divides all commentaries to two: ones part is\non edicts-attempts to clarify obscure legal or ritual texts,\ntranslate legal terms, etc. He intended to preset this part as\nuncritically as he could. The idea that whatever is no edict is\nreport is his hypothesis, tacitly endorsed in Jewish Studies in\ngeneral. Also, and much worse, it is insinuated there that the\ndichotomy of all texts to edicts and reports is traditional. (The\n(con)fusion here is of a traditional contrast with a recent\ndichotomy.) It stands to reason that this dichotomy is not\nstrictly true, yet it is endorsed as a matter of course. The\nreason is simple: if in Jewish texts all non-edicts are reports,\nthen the traditional Rabbinical protection of edicts from queries\nbased on reports protects edicts from all queries based on Jewish\ntexts, so that keeping edicts off limits makes Jewish Studies,\nhowever critical, scarcely capable of heresy. Is this ploy\nsuccessful? I think not.\nWhat do reports tell us about edicts? Zunz, it seems, was in\ntwo minds about this question. In the opening of his seventh\nchapter he goes so far as to declare that the separation of halakha\nand agada holds even for the Old Testament itself. Yet in the\nsecond paragraph of his fourth chapter he stresses that the two\nintertwine. What is the problem here is very clear: he wanted to\ntake license regarding reports that he did not dare take regarding\nedicts. On this he was, of course, following the ancient ruling:\n**one does not query an edict on the basis of a report**. He explains\nthis ruling cogently when he introduces the very distinction (first\nparagraph of Chapter Four) between edicts and reports: edicts require\nconsensus, but reports merely inform that someone has said something\nor other. This will not do: the biblical reports have all the\nauthority of the Word of God. Maccoby offers a somewhat different\nexplanation (1988, p. 21): edicts do and reports do not undergo the\ndecision process that is required to render an item authoritative.\nThis, too, is not satisfactory, as some reports have the stamp of\nauthority as even Maccoby reluctantly hints (* loc. cit*): &#34;The\nauthority of the * haggadah* is very different&#34;, yet he ascribes the\nauthority of ay report &#34;simply to its poetic force&#34;. He &#34;simply&#34;\nshould not have said\nthis.\nThis information is broached not in order to contest Zunz'\nreading of all the Rabbinical literature in a sense commentaries,\nnor his dichotomy of all these commentaries to edicts and reports,\nbut in order to highlight a problem that his followers met but not\nA tense, dialectical relationship between religion in\nessence and religion in manifestation is at the core of the\nJewish religious consciousness- its legal configuration and\nits historical experience. Halakhah is the indispensable\nmanifestation prescribed concretization of an underlying and\noverriding spiritual essence, a volatile, magnetic and\nincompressible religious force designated as Judaism. The\ntension flows from the painful awareness that manifestation\nand essence sometimes drift apart, from the sober\nrecognition that the carefully constructed, finely chiseled\nnormative system cannot regularly reflect, refract, or\nenergize interior, fluid, spiritual forces and motives.\nYet, if the system is to remain vibrant, it must. If\nHalakhah is the means for the actualization and celebration\nof ethical norms, historical experiences, and theological\npostulates, then external conformity must be nurtured by\ninternal sensibility and spirituality.\nI will not degrade the great scholar who wrote these words by\ncareful analysis or by reporting in detail the elaboration of it in\na detailed and scholarly paper whose apex (* ibid.*, p.\n76) is the assertion that some very important ideas are better left\nin the dark. Rather let me say that through the excessively\nfigurative language the author expresses a difficulty that he\nhonestly feels as if it is inherent in Judaism-despite the obvious\nfact that for most Jews the quote, or the whole essay, is\nincomprehensible and insignificant, and despite the fact that many\nJewish thinkers, such as Martin Buber and Gershom Scholem, deny\nthat there is an essence of Judaism, not to mention the notable\nfact that essentialism is nowadays in ill-repute.\nThe Talmud offers lists of traditional hermeneutic ways of\nreading a text, plain reading (the unsophisticated reading of a\ntext) is one, and different methods of commentary [medrashim] on\nit, four, thirteen or thirty-two, depending on one's\nclassification, of course. Commentary in this sense should not be\nconfused with sense in which all literature past the Old Testament\nare (according to Zunz) commentaries one way or another. Attempts\nto comprehend difficult texts, attempts to remove some\nmisunderstanding rooted in changes of situations, attempts to give\nvariant meanings of a word, and so on, all of which are subsumed\nunder the label of hermeneutics in the modern sense, they are all\nplain interpretations or plain commentaries. These, Zunz showed,\nare done by reviewing ancient customs, by comparing texts sharing\nobscure words, and by translations; from the viewpoint of Jewish\nStudies these differences do not matter half as much as the\nquestion, is the text under scrutiny an edict or a report?\nNevertheless, from the scientific viewpoint there is a world of\ndifference between the plain commentary, intended to be as much a\nstraight interpretation as possible, what these days we usually\ncall hermeneutics [pshat], and other commentaries on a text\n[medrashim], which offer less obvious readings, of a kind not\nincluded in what these days we usually call hermeneutics; they are\noften bluntly anachronistic, and at times they scarcely relate to\nthe texts to which they are appended (allegedly) as commentaries;\nthey may easily be really fanciful, namely have no more than flimsy\nassociations with the plain readings of the texts, and then, as\noften as not, they are hardly reinterpretations but merely\ndiscourses tagged onto texts according to given customary rules so\nfamiliar today from sermons which start with sacred quotes as mere\ntakeoff points; the texts then may serve as mere pretexts for the\ncommentaries [medrashim] allegedly on them. The most important\nnovelty on this matter is Lieberman's evidence (1962, pp. 68-82)\nthat however far- fetched they look to us today, they were current\nin antiquity not only among Jews. (Some of them, he shows, were\ndeemed by non-scholars even in antiquity as too far-fetched.)\nThe traditional hermeneutic contrast between edict and report\nis often read by the inexpert as the hermeneutic contrast between\nplain reading of a text and a (fanciful) commentary on it- for the\nreason that as often as not the (possibly fanciful) commentary\ninclude a (possibly fanciful) report. Often, however, the report\nis tagged to a commentary that discusses an edict proper, and then\nthe report is intended to serve as a means of validation-of the\nsort prevalent in mythical discourse of all traditions-such as a\nreport of some conduct in accord with the edict or the commentary,\nallegedly exhibited by some individual who is evidently a role\nmodel. As the subject-matter of a commentary regards at times an\nedict and at times a report (the traditional distinction is between\n&#34;medrash halakha&#34; and &#34;medrash agada&#34;), the\nwrong identification is very convenient, as it may permit the\ncritical assessment of a medrash halakha on the pretence that it is\nnot an edict but a report. In addition to this, it is convenient\nto examine cases where clearly the critical comment on a report\ndoes not reflect any criticism of any edict. Even Lieberman is not\nfree of this, as the following may illustrate. When he endorses\nthe distinction between edict and report (1974, p. 273), he\nobserves that the Sages were not averse to the use of pagan laws\nand of current events to illuminate ancient lore. Such discourses,\nhe seems to insinuate, cannot possibly be relevant to questions of\nthe validity of an edict or of a reading of an edict. This is true\nand very convincing as far as it goes, but it suggests an\nextrapolation that is palpably false, that is admitted without\nraising the reader's suspicion as long as the cautious scholar\nexamines cases which are unproblematic and ignores the mine- field\nof problematic cases. Yet he gives no hint at the fact that the\nliterature is problematic; a simple, unquestionable report may\neasily suggest that an edict is not valid, and yet such suggestions\nare in principle invalid and void. Why?\nOne should not identify the traditional Jewish hermeneutic rule\nforbidding the questioning of an edict on the basis of a report\nwith the critique which traditional classical western philosophy\noffers (and which is usually ascribed to David Hume) of any\ninference from facts to norms, from what is the case to what it\nshould be, from reports to edicts. The traditional philosophical\nhermeneutic rule concerns the invalidity of some inferences, and\nthe traditional Jewish hermeneutic rule blocks valid ones.\nGenerally speaking, all invalidity of inference can easily be\nrectified by some added premise which is very easy to discover.\nThe smoothest rectification of any invalid inference from premises\nto conclusion is the additional premise which is a conditional\nstatement, asserting that if what the premises say hold so does\nwhat the conclusion says. [When the inference from p to q is\n(possibly) invalid, the inference can be (assuredly) rectified by\nadding the premise if-p-then-q; if the inference is invalid, then\nthis addition renders it valid; if the inference is valid, then the\naddition makes no difference, as it is uninformative: it is a\ntautology.] Any sentence that includes this added premise will do\ntoo, of course. [If q does not follow from p, while if-p-then-q\nfollows from r, then q does follow from the two premises, p and r.]\nIn the case at hand, the premise which will render valid a\nconclusion from a report to an edict may be (the edict) that the\nreport presents a role model. [The following inference is valid:\nthe conduct of Moses the law-giver is a model of propriety; he\nperformed a magical act; therefore, performing magical acts may be\nproper.] The philosophical rule tell us nothing about the propriety\nor otherwise of learning about edicts from reports on role models;\nyet classical philosophy regularly recommended natural conduct,\ncommon to all humans, and then deduced rules of conduct from claims\nabout the naturalness of some mode of conduct or another. For\nexample, David Hume deemed greed common to all humans, and hence\nnatural, and he concluded that greed is commendable. Similarly,\ngiven that some conduct or the conduct of some person is a model,\nsome inferences from reports about conduct to norms are rendered\nquite valid. It is this kind of valid inference that is precluded\nby the traditional hermeneutic rule that blocks the questioning of\nan edict from reports; indeed, were the inference invalid, there\nwould be no need to block it.\n3. The Place of Magic in Jewish Law\nLet us dwell a bit on the examp le from Moses. There is an\nedict against magic and there is the report that Moses has\nperformed magic acts in the court of the Pharaoh, during his\nnegotiations with the Pharaoh-not to confuse with the miracles he\nperformed later on. Clearly, there is a logical contradiction\nhere, rooted in the view of Moses as a role model: were it\npermissible to view his magic acts as wrong, there would be no\nproblem here, whether or not we accept his other conduct as\nbecoming a role model. The claim that Moses was a perfect role\nmodel is report, not an edict, of course. There are, of course,\nreports to the contrary: some cases of misconduct performed by\nsome role models, such as the idolatry of King Solomon and the\ngrumble of Miriam, sister of Moses, are expressly reported as not\nto be emulated, of course. In the context of the present\ndiscussion they are unproblematic as long as they are singled out\nas faulty. Nor is it problematic to observe that a role model has\nexhibited some faulty conduct not to be emulated, of course. It is\nbecause Moses is reported to constitute the most perfect role model\nthat Moses did perform a magic act, together yield a contradiction.\nThe same problem is posed by any action of any role model not\nsingled out as faulty. Hence, in the cases singled out here a\nquery on an edict from a report may be resolved by declaring the\ncase an exception; the problem persists because some role models\nwill not allow such exceptions. Not only Moses, but also the\nPatriarches are perfect role models, and the Patriarch Jacob is\nreported to have performed magic acts proper (in determining the\ncolor of the offspring of the sheep he was herding). The Talmud\neven declared King David a perfect role model, the story of Bath\nSheba notwithstanding. This may suggest that the whole matter is\nnot serious, since David's conduct in this case is clearly declared\nin Scripture to have been faulty. This matter should be discussed\nat a later stage; first, serious attention should be given to the\ncontradiction inherent in the case of Moses as a perfect role model\nwho has performed magic despite the prohibition on such acts. What\nis the resolution of this contradiction?\nThere are different avenues to explore here. Any of the\nfollowing suggestions resolves the contradiction.\n(1) Moses performed magic proper by a special dispensation,\n(2) Moses performed not magic proper but a miracle.\n(3) Moses performed not magic proper but a mere sleight of hand.\nThe first move is evidently one which the Sages were reluctant\nto employ-presumably because it is too arbitrary. To say this,\nhowever, is to admit that stories have moral to them, contrary to\nthe hermeneutic rule here under examination, namely that there is\nno query from a report to an edict. If the second move is\npermitted, it forces upon us the question, what demarcates magic\nfrom miracles? Indeed, magic is often called &#34;miracle&#34;\nin the West, e.g. in &#34;miracle cures&#34;, and magicians,\nindividuals who possess special powers, who can regularly perform\nmiracles, are described not as magicians but as holy or inspired\nsaintly and righteous people [tzadikim]- just because only magic is\nforbidden, not miracles; this misnomer is ancient, going back, say,\nto the miracles performed by the prophet Elisha, and common in both\nJewish and Christian hagiography to date. When a court of law is\nsupposed to impose the law against the performance of magic or to\nrecognize a miracle, then the question at hand can scarcely be\navoided. At times it is raised even in folk-tales. A conspicuous\nexample is the story of the modern Jewish writer J.L. Peretz,\n&#34;The Miracle Maker&#34;, where even an answer to it is\nprovided, a criterion for demarcation between miracles and magic,\nno less: if the products of the act are real, it is miraculous,\nnot magical. In other words, in the opinion of Peretz, Jewish Law\ndoes not recognize magic proper, i.e., effective magic. This\namounts to the endorsement of the third and last option: the magic\nperformed by Moses in the court of the Pharaoh was mere sleight of\nhand: declaring such a blatant magic act a sleight of hand amounts\nto declaring sleight of hand no magic. (Hypnosis, incidentally, if\nrecognized at all, must be considered mere sleight of hand.)\nClearly, the discussion here must bifurcate, as it can be\nconducted while affirming or denying the postulate that magic is\npossible. On the denial, either there is no magic or else all\nmagic is but sleight of hand. On its affirmation, however,\nclearly, both magic and miracles are supernatural (i.e., in\nviolation of the laws of nature), the latter by blessed divine\nintervention , the other by &#34;the other side&#34; [sitra\nahara, i.e. fiendish], and so is strictly forbidden by Jewish Law.\nThe distinction between the divine and the fiendish supernatural is\nno small matter; the Royal Society of London, founded in 1660, was\ndevoted to natural knowledge, in the intention to exclude any\ndiscussion of the supernatural. This was a great shame, as at the\ntime witch-hunts were carried out full-blast in England and\nviolated the slim rights of women, yet the Royal Society did not\nintervene. Clearly its members feared that denying the possible\nefficacy of magic they would expose themselves to charges of\nimpiety, both because Scriptures clearly forbid magic and because\ndenying magic is but a step to denying miracles.\nTo return to our problem, it matters little what option one\nchooses to solve the contradiction at hand: either way, the report\nabout Moses' conduct does teach us something about magic, contrary\nto the traditional Jewish hermeneutic rule forbidding queries from\nreports to edicts. And this is really inevitable, as the inference\nis valid from a role model to a rule of conduct. We now have to\nresolve the contradiction between the traditional hermeneutic rule\nthat edicts are not to be contrasted with reports with the valid\ncontrast between some reports concerning some role models and some\nedicts.\nThe simplest way of so doing is to read the rule this way:\nleast) one of them has to be modified or qualified, it is always\nthe report that should be qualified, never the edict. In other\nwords, the rule is the claim that a report cannot invalidate an\nedict even though, as we have seen, it can help us comprehend it.\nThis, however, is unsatisfactory, since the comprehension is often\na limitation of the edict and thus a kind of invalidation. One\nshould therefore go further and observe that under such conditions\nit is better to abstain: after all, not all contradictions that\nthe Sages have discovered were resolved. Some are admitted to be\nunresolved and wait for further discussion [teiqu]. If so, then\none can add, if there is a conflict between a ruling and a report,\nthe conflict may remain unresolved, yet the edict should not be\nweakened. This, I suggest, is the real meaning of the ruling not\nto query an edict on the basis of a report.\nThis is not to say that edicts are not weakened or otherwise\ntempered with (all scholars in the field agree that this is a\nregular event in Jewish history though they are reluctant to say\nso). This is not to say that orthodoxy and criticism are always\ndeemed incompatible (some of the more critical scholars in the\nfield are known to be sincerely orthodox Jews). It is only an\nattempt to read a ruling in line with the intended meaning of it.\nFor an example of all this we may wish to return to witchcraft.\nThe biblical edict is clear: thou shalt not suffer a witch to\nlive. Yet, if one thing is clear from the writings of Lieberman\n(1950), it is that ancient Jewish society was as seeped in magic as\nthe whole region, and the Sages preferred to confine it rather than\nto fight it. Reports to that extent certainly qualify the edicts\nagainst magic one way or another. Yet edicts are not always that\nclearly stated in the Old Testament, and so are in danger of being\noverruled on the ground of a report. The rule in question, then,\nmay indeed save them from such a fate.\nOne might object that the example I have conjured is but a\ntrick. If we view Moses' acts miraculous and we declare miracles\nno longer possible, then the problem disappears. If we assume\neither that magic is but conjurers' tricks or that magic proper\nnever existed, then the contradiction I have offered and resolved\nhere may be declared no problem from the very start and thus a mere\nfake.\nUnfortunately this will not do: the Talmudic edict on magic is\nindeed what is presented here. In the Talmud miracles are allowed,\nnot only for the distant past: they are reported as parts of the\nlives of some Sages. Nevertheless, it seems clear that the Talmud\nallows or even encourages faith in miracles on the strict condition\nthat they do not interfere with any edict. Likewise, in the Talmud\nsleights of hand are discussed [Sanhedrin] as possible acts of\nmagic, and they are explicitly ruled out as mere deceptions for the\ngullible, and so no magic at all. More important, though it is\nneve r explicitly stated, it is understood that the same holds for\nfutile magic, like worthless potions with alleged magic powers.\nThis is so because the two edicts in question (first, that miracles\ndo not impinge on conduct and second that sleights of hand and fake\nmagic are insignificant) is not so superfluous as it seems. It is\nclear that at least as far as edicts are concerned, the Sages ruled\nthe supernatural impossible, magic or no magic [simana lav milta\nhavve]: indications are that they deemed sheer superstition all\nfaith in the supernatural, be it miracles or magic, be the magic\nwitchcraft, sorcery, physiognomy, necromancy, charm, adjuration or\ndivination. (Lieberman's great contribution here is his study of\nthe prevalence of superstition in the ancient world; he even showed\nthat &#34;bat kol&#34;, a voice from heaven, is scarcely a\nmiracle and more often a superstitious reading of signs allegedly\nhidden in ordinary events. See his 1962, pp. 194ff. The\nprevalence of superstition, he suggests, * passim*, made\nit incumbent on the Sages to try to contain it rather than fight\nit.) To bridge between the letter of the law and the disregard of\nthe supernatural it is quite convenient to dismiss miracles and\nmagic as marginal, as sheer fancy: the belief that someone has\nperformed a miracle or a magic act proper is, of course, the\nsuperstitious faith in the efficacy of miracles or of magic in the\nface of the desire to deny it or even in the face of the desire\nmerely to abolish it.\nThis is clearly not the attitude exhibited in Scriptures\ntowards the supernatural, though a crucial passage in the\nBook of Deuteronomy* is explicit on the matter of the ritual\ninsignificance of the supernatural: in a discussion of the\ndemarcation between true and false prophecies we are told in no\ntrue prophecy is admonition. Future miracles are possible, then,\nbut they are of no import: true prophets are armed not with\ncontrols over the forces of nature but with moral force of their\nown.\nIf the supernatural is to be inferior to morality, then, why\nmiracles? This is a very difficult question. It receives two\ntraditional answers which are very similar. First, miracles are\nthe meant to persuade simple people to behave properly. Second,\nthough reason suffices, revelation is the second chance that the\nGood Lord has kindly offered people who would foolishly relinquish\nreason. The difference between the two answers concerns respect\nfor common people, and is thus scarcely relevant to the present\ndiscussion.\n4. The Law and Magic Today\nThe world is divided today to the scientific and the magical.\nThe scientific has rules of evidence, theories, and scientific\ntechnology. The magical has myth and rituals, these including\nmagic proper, witchcraft, sorcery, physiognomy, chiromancy,\nnecromancy, charm, abjuration, divination and much more: it\nencompasses myth and superstition and all sorts of rituals enacting\nthem. In a pinch pseudo-science-astrology and alchemy and folk\nmedicine etc.-are included in magic. This is a bit of cheating\ndesigned to defend the false dichotomy. It is cheating, as\npseudo-science disregards ritual proper and its connection with\nmyth proper may be casual. Even superstition is not magic, though\nit shares with magic the vagueness of reference and thus\nuntestability (whereas pseudo-science is often refuted theories or\nfragments of them). Thus, besides magic and science there are\nother sorts of beliefs, contrary to the dichotomy of all ideas to\nmagic and science. The advocates of the dichotomy stick to it as\nit supports the foolish claim that &#34;our&#34; (admittedly\nscientific) society is purely scientific with no magic practices,\nno pseudo-science, no ideas but science. This foolish view is\ncalled positivism, or rather it is the view that the philosophy\ncalled positivism (i.e. stick to science and disown all else) is at\nall possible in a human society. Jarvie and I have argued (1987)\nthat no society is utterly free of magic and superstition and\npseudo-science and dogma. Even were the dichotomy true, the\nfoolish idea that we are scientific would not hold: since no one\ndenies that some knowledge possessed by even the most primitive\nsocieties can ascend to the status of scientific knowledge, and\nsince there still is some magic in our midst, at best the dichotomy\nshould be replaced with grading. But there is more to it than\nthat. In the ancient Hebrew doctrine myth abounds but magic is\nforbidden, whereas its attitude to superstitions is mixed.\nThis is surprising, and it is hardly noticed in the literature,\nas it introduces a new distinction between magic and myth. That\nbiblical and Talmudic lore are full of myth need scarcely be\nmentioned. That magic is forbidden by Hebrew Law is likewise\nwell-known. This is most unusual yet hardly noted. There is no\ndoubt that the literature does not permit myth with no magic. For\nexample, when it is noted that Plato's writings exhibit myth with\nno magic, commentators dismiss this by the claim that Plato's\nalleged myths are not myths but parables. Even were this so, it is\nhardly reasonable to say of modern (say, Sorrel-style)\nirrationalist ideologies that they are not myth-ridden or that they\nadvocate magic.\nThis is not to say that the Hebrew prohibition on magic was\npracticed; even to examine this one needs more specifications of\nwhat is magic, and we lack these specifications. Come to think of\nit, this is very unusual in Hebrew Law, and more so in Talmudic\nLaw. The prohib itions in the Old Testament are usually\nwell-specified, and the Talmud goes much further in the\ndescriptions and specifications of the prohibited. Some\nspecifications are mentioned in the Old Testament, to be sure, for\nexample, necromancy and divination are explicitly forbidden in\naddition to magic. But the whole matter is obviously shrouded in\nmystery, perhaps because of the magic stories that the Old\nTestament is full of, perhaps because certain biblical rituals are\nundeniably magical in character. Talmudic specification of\nforbidden magic such as they are come under the heading of\nforbidden idolatry, scarcely of forbidden magic. It should be\nnoted that though sacrificing animals is obviously a magical act,\nand is so presented when sacrifices are first introduced in the Old\nTestament, in the story of Cain and Abel, it still is\ncontestable-and contested-that the sacrificial rituals in the\nis undeniably magical, as the poor woman is made to drink accursed\nbitter water-water used to clean the piece of parchment on which\nsome curses had been written by a priest with the ashes of a\nspecific sacrifice-on the expectation of a summary verdict: the\naccursed bitter water causes the body of the guilty to swell up.\nThe question which a modern reader tends to ask in this context\nis, is the biblical viewpoint scientific? Or at least, can it be\nread in a more-or-less scientific mood? This question betrays the\ndogmatic adherence to the dichotomy between the scientific and the\nmagical. It is better to ask, how critical was this or that\nproduct of this or that writer, compiler, or editor of a given\nbiblical text, and what was the object of the criticism? In\nparticular, what abomination did they and what did they forbid?\nMaimonides had a hint at a general answer when he discussed the\nlaws of animal sacrifice: it was a concession to the ignorant\nmultitude, only reluctantly made. Lieberman makes this a general\nrule, as we have seen.\nHow cogent is this reading? The biblical injunction against\nmagic seems to reaffirm the faith in the possible efficacy of magic\nacts while proscribing or exorcising them, but, possibly it is\nmeant, on the contrary, as the attempt to dissuade people from\npartaking in any superstitious conduct based on faith in the\nsupernatural, an attempt based on the rejection of all faith in all\nsupernatural events, sacred, abominable or profane. It is\nconvenient, in this context, that a verse in the Scriptures says,\n&#34;there is no divination in Jacob [lo nakhash beyaakov]&#34;;\nthe trouble is caused by the biblical stories of effective miracles\nand effective magic (by the righteous and by the wicked alike), as\nwell as by the biblical edicts, such as the verse &#34;thou shalt\nnot let a witch live&#34; (why witch rather than wizard and witch\nis not clear, since wizards are treated no better than witches) and\nby rituals like the testing of a wife's fidelity by serving her\naccursed bitter water. There are, of course, many instances of\npeople who do not believe in the supernatural, who try to banish\nit, yet who speak as if they endorse it: they know how ubiquitous\nfaith in the supernatural is, and they find the outright denial of\nit a barrier to communication with those whom they wish to\ndissuade. The conduct of those who speak as if they do believe in\nthe supernatural while fighting this very belief is thus quite\ncomprehensible. The supposition that this holds for the Old\nTestament-which is far from being self-evident-renders much of it\nharmless, then, but it still does not make the acceptance of the\ntext as it stands comfortable: even if the text thus read allows\nthe denial of the supernatural, the question remains, what should\none do with the miracles and the magic which permeate the ancient\ntext, not to mention the iniquity of the intolerance expressed in\nthe readiness to execute anyone imputed with magic (in truth or\nnot)? It is possible to understand the injunction to execute a\nwitch as applicable to anyone who claims to be a magician and/or\nwho performs some allegedly magic acts, of course. Will that\nsettle matters? The historian may condone the intolerant edict\nagainst them as a means of reform, and one may even suggest that\nthe intolerant edict is a mere threat, not a real instruction to\nexecute any witch (especially in view of the Talmudic surreptitious\nreform that practically abolished all capital punishment).\nAll this involves a relatively easy matter of historical study\nand a very difficult matter of a moral decision. The historical\nquestion is this. Were people executed under biblical edicts for\nhaving claimed to have performed magic acts? Let me postpone the\ndiscussion of this, factual question, and center now on the hard,\nmoral one: is it just to force people out of a superstition by the\nmeans of expressing the intolerant biblical edict (thou shalt not\nsuffer a witch to live) without ever practicing it? It may be\nargued that the threat of a death penalty is justified by the fact\nthat allowing a superstition to persevere is dangerous. But then\nthere is a strong argument against an intolerant edict even if not\npracticed: it is easy for a rogue to abuse an intolerant edict\neven if the edict is not ever practiced, to use it to prove the\nmerit of some intolerance. And this is harmful as well, of course.\nHow can there be a rational decision between these two options?\nThe question should be generalized. The Old Testament\nexpresses intolerance not only in matters regarding the\nsupernatural. Moses is reported to have passed the death penalty\non a man who broke the law of the Sabbath. Is this not too\nintolerant? Can we explain this intolerance as rooted not in\nreligious fanaticism but in some reasonable, if false, idea about\nthe need of civil society for civil order that justifies the\nlike the taboo on labor on the Sabbath?\nThere is, here, an open secret, which is very hard to discuss,\nas its discussion is often rejected by the claim that the secret is\nvery well-known indeed-even though the point of the discussion is\nnot the secret itself but the taboo on it. Now clearly a taboo on\nany discussion is very difficult to discuss, as such discussion is\na violation of the taboo. This is a serious matter: when we\ndiscuss a prohibition, the rule of fairness demands that we assume\nit is possibly valid possibly not. Any prohibition which does not\nyield to such a rule of fairness is simply not given to rational\ndiscourse. Suppose we meet an individual who denies the\nprohibition to kill a human being-to take real examples, because\nthe human in question is a Jew, a black or a woman or a newly-born\ninfant. Public debates about their opinions are just out of\nquestion, even though propaganda is permissible and perhaps even\nrequired. Private debates with such people are scarcely possible\nin the sense that one can scarcely abide by the rule of fairness.\nIf one does carry out debates with such individuals, then they are\nnot quite fair. This is hard to stomach, and many scholars will\nnot agree, but I, for one, will not debate this matter with them.\nAssuming the rule of fairness, debating the idea that debating\nsome matter is forbidden has to be taken as possibly true, and so\nthe discussion is possibly harmful. How can this be mitigated? At\ntimes it can be mitigated by reading the prohibition to apply to\npublic debates only and by holding secret debates. Or by assuming\nthat the prohibition holds for debates with outsiders - non-Jews,\nnon-blacks, males, enemies-and holding the debates in the community\nof the faithful. This is acceptable on the condition that if the\ndebate leads to the criticism of the prohibition, some steps should\nbe permitted for the efforts to lift it. Reading a prohibition to\ndebate to hold under all circumstances makes it plainly\nobjectionable on this very ground. This overcomes the taboo on\ndiscussions on the possible need to reform Jewish Law.\nThe most powerful argument against such a discussion is that\nJewish Law is the Word of God. It is clear that assuming this to\nbe the case still raises possibilities of reforms, and Jewish\nhistory has ample testimony to that effect. There remains one more\nstrong argument against the debate on reform of Jewish Law, and it\nsi that it threatens the unite of the Jewish Poeple. This invites\nsome discusssion.\n5. The Civil View of Religion\nThere is ample evidence that many thinkers, religious and\nirreligious alike, took preaching hell- fire and brimstone essential\nto the stability of civil society, and social stability as\nessential to all that we value. We still do not know if a society\nwithout a religion is possible, because all human societies, even\nthose governed by the most secular regimes, are populated by mostly\nreligious people. But we do now know that the view of stability is\nan error: today the idea of stability is increasingly replaced by\nthe idea of social (democratic) control. (See Popper, 1945.) This\nidea can easily be read as, religion is but a means of control of\nthe masses. This reading is traditional, and it is probably first\nexpressed in Macchavelli's * The Prince*, for which he\nwas more censured than for his advice to rulers to be ruthless (see\nAgassi, 1986). The result was that sincerely religious individual\ncould no freely discuss the political import of religion and all\nthose who did discuss it were taken to be irreligious. This was\nnot so bad, as the thrust of Macchavelli's discussion of religion\nwas the attempt to separate state and church in an effort to\ninstitute religious toleration, and, indeed, the discussion of\nreligious toleration took precedence over the question of the\npolitical import of religion in general. And when the matter of\nreligious toleration was exhausted, the discussion of the political\nimport of religion was conducted by social thinkers who were\nhostile to religion, who took it as a matter of course to be sheer\nsuperstition.\nThe methodology these social thinkers was simple: ignore the\nmyth and look at the ritua l. (See Jarvie, 1964 and Agassi, 1977.)\nThis methodology is dangerous, as it takes all beliefs except\nscientific ones to be worse than silly, namely, insincere. It\namounts to a profound disrespect for the common people. Its best\nknown advocate was Durkheim, who took magic to be nothing but a\ncement for tribal unity and religion for national unity. Of\ncourse, this contemptuous attitude has its impact even on those\nJews who take rituals as inviolable but faith as insignificant,\ncan accuse them of is intentional contempt for the naive believer:\nthey still exhibit such contempt, though it is merely unintended.\nThe obviously more commonsensical attitude to the matter of the\npolitical attitude to religion is to ignore the matters of the\nvalidity of any faith while discussing its political import. This\nhas its drawbacks, to be sure, especially since political and\nreligious thinking cannot be neatly separated. Yet as a first\napproximation the exercise may be enlightening.\nThe best example I know of this is a humble book, obviously by\nan amateur of a limited familiarity with primary sources, who\nexcels in common sense and in political concern. I have in mind\nBerl Gross, * Before Democracy* of 1992, in which he\nfollows another amateur, the forgotten 19th century Fabius Mises.\nGross presents ancient religions as most religions, as containing\nideas not conducive to individual freedom. The novelty of\nAbaraham's religion he presents not as monotheism, and so he is not\nin the least concerned with its origins. Rather, he sees in\nAbraham a preacher of toleration. Moses, next, is presented as a\nreformer of the politics of religion, with the ideal of a\ndecentralized tribal society with each tribe settled on its land\ndivided to family plots. This makes Moses the first utopian\nexperimenter. The idea of a decentralized tribal society raises\nproblems, and Gross sees in Moses' legislation attempts to overcome\nthem, such as the law that the land of a family with daughters only\npasses to the daughters on the condition that they marry within the\ntribe, and that land cannot be sold for more than fifty years and\nthat the priests [the tribe of Levi] were landless.\nGross' point is in the wake of the philosophy of karl Popper of\ntrial and error. He declares that history was distorted because of\nthe failure to acknowledge the failure of Moses' program: it was\nnever executed due to the Philistine invasion, the Philistine use\nof iron, and the appearance of military chariots. As to the\nfailure, he describes the dispersion of the army of Joshua with no\nheir as a tacit admission of failure of the Mosaic experiment,\nwhich led to the period of the Judges, when the Israeli tribal\nsociety dissipated due to the failure of the experiment, yet while\nblaming the common people, not while admitting error. The age of\nSamuel is then described as the rather successful revival of the\nMosaic program by uniting the tribes to fight the Philistines\nwhich, however, could not be sustained and so it led to the demise\nof that program with the establishment of a monarchy, centralism\nand a cast of priests [Cohanim].\nGross presents a picture that is riddled with problems. But\nhis program is clear, he shows more respect to Jewish religion then\nthe leading scholars in the field-by ignoring the question of its\nvalidity altogether, and instead speaking of the politics if\npriesthoods. He suggests that Moses ideas follow the failure of\nthe Egyptian ruler to rid the country of the yoke of the\npriesthood. This explains much of the social and political aspects\nof the Mosaic Law, while insisting that the book of\nLeviticus* is simply contrary to that spirit. This is not as\nheretic as it sounds, as the prophets stressed the same sentiment\nrepeatedly, and the Talmudic edict goes with it too: sins against\nfellow humans, it says, are worse than sins against the Holy,\nBlessed be He, as those of the one kind are also of the other.\nThis is not the end of the story, since the Israeli Rabbinate, for\nexample, has totally disregarded this edict to the shame of all\nIsraelis, all Jews and the whole of the Jewish tradition, prophecy\nand Talmud alike, orthodox and humanist alike.\nIt is clear that many issues of great concern for Jewish\nscholars are of no interest to Gross, especially problems of,\norigins and of priority. He even does not mind much what solution\none accepts to the Mosaic problem, namely, who exactly Moses was?\nHis only concern is with the socio-political ideas that were\nexpressed in the Books of Moses, describing a decentralized tribal\nsociety working on family plots and serving no central authority.\nHe argues that it is a great innovation, a utopian experiment, and\nconjectures that it evolved in reaction to the centralized,\nclerical regime of Egypt. And so he argues that all the texts\nrelating to the status of priests are late (post Davidic)\ninterpolations, citing passages that indicate that in early periods\nthe tribe of Levi played the role of priests and there was no\nspecific recognition of the Cohen family of that ruled the Temple\nrituals and the rites they came to replace.\nTalmud (to be partly revived in Israel as means of clericalist\ncontrol). He rejects the traditional reading of much of the Old\nTestament, but this is a sin hardly any Old Testament scholar is\nfree of, even if Gross' transgressions are quite unusual and\nlarge-scale. That in a clear sense his reading is imposing and\nmore complimentary to Jewish tradition than is usual is also quite\nclear, so that from the orthodox viewpoint as well as from the\nscientific viewpoint one can hardly express an outright\ncondemnation or commendation of his work.\nThis is very disquieting. As Gross' moral is socio-political\nand not religious, it is hard to ignore it: he says, not admitting\nfailure openly prevents learning from it, particularly the\ninstitution of the lesson from it. This is how things stand today.\nWho will dare take them further from here, and will the do so as\npolitical thinkers, moralists, Bible scholars or religious\nthinkers?\nREFERENCES\nAgassi, Joseph, 1977, * Towards A\nRational Philosophical Anthropology*, Kluwer,\nDordrecht.\nAgassi, Joseph, 1993, &#34;Reason\nwithin the Limits of Religion Alone: the Case of\nMaimonides&#34;, * Boston Studies in the Philosophy of\nScience*, forthcoming.\nAgassi, Joseph, 1986, &#34;Towards a\nCanonic Version of Classical Political Theory&#34;, in\nMarjorie Grene and Debra Nails, editors, * Spinoza and\nthe Sciences, Boston Studies*, 1986. 153-70.\nAgassi, Joseph and I.C.

 u"Giuseppe Franco, editor, Der Kritische Rationalismus als Denkmethode und\nLebensweise: Festscrhift zum 90. Geburtstag von Hans Albert. Klagenfurt: Kitab,\n2012, 34-55\nCritical Rationalism, Comprehensive or Qualified:\nThe Popper-Bartley Dispute\nBy Joseph Agassi,\nTel-Aviv University and York University, Toronto\n0. Background.\nKarl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945,\nCh. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason.\nLater on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and\neven called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to\nhis annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave,\n1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter\nis very complicated. Let me show this now.\nFideism is a minimal retreat from classical rationalism. As this theory is\ncomprehensive in its demand for proof as ultimate justification, it begs the question\nof its own justification. All parties to the current dispute admit that this is a defect\nthat has no cure except by some modification. To that end adherents to fideism\nadvocate some axiom taken on faith as the minimum necessary concession to\nirrationalism. The rationalism that the advocates of fideism qualify is the classical\ntheory of rationality, that is, to be precise, an assertion plus a demand. The theory is,\nrationality equals proof. The demand is to make an assertion \u2013 or to endorse it, to\nbelieve it \u2013 if and only if proof is available that the assertion is true. As the skeptics\nhave shown, any proof of any (synthetic) assertion requires a proof theory that\nrequires proof in its turn. (The possibly of proof in logic and in mathematics has no\nplace in the present discussion.) The skeptics have then recommended holding no\nbelief, making no definite assertion, holding all views only tentatively. Skeptics\nclaim that they have a proof that no proof is possible that should satisfy classical\nrationalists. Most rationalists have invested much effort in attempts to find fault in\nthat proof, and they are still trying. As this essay concerns the dispute between\nPopper and Bartley, who both endorse the skeptic proof, we may take the skeptical\nproof for granted. Hence, the classical theory of rationality cannot stay as it is. The\nadvocates of fideism conclude, then, that some retreat is imperative. The minimal\ndeviation is an assertion that advocates of fideism recommend to endorse without\nproof. That is to say, they recommend its endorsement upon faith. There are two\nstandard candidates for that assertion: the principle of induction and the faith of one\u2019s\nforefathers.\nOf course, not all deviation from the classical theory of rationality is fideist.\nSince advocates of fideism propose that the deviation from the old view should be\nminimal, it is hard to see how this proposal is contestable. An obvious point to\ncontest concerns the question, what deviation is minimal. On this Popper has made a\nbrilliant alternative proposal. Although it has not gained popularity among advocates\nof fideism, it is obviously the best thus far offered. It is this. The least concession\nshould not be the faith in any principle of induction, much less in a given traditional\nfaith, but preferably in the possibility that rational debate may generate progress.\nAdvocates of fideism may object to this obviously superior proposal: it accompanies\na lower standard of rationality. Whereas the classical theory of rationality equates\nrationality with proof, Popper\u2019s theory equates rationality with the critical attitude.\nWhat is preferable, one irrational axiom or this reduction of the standard? The\nanswer is that the reduction of the standard is necessary anyway since the skeptical\ncriticism of traditional rationalism is valid. (Thus, Bertrand Russell advocated the\nadoption of some principle of induction upon faith in the hope that it will suffice to\njustify current science [Russell, 1992, 38]; [Russell, 1996, 313-28]. He did not\nmanage to formulate it explicitly.)\nPopper has proposed two brilliant minimizing moves: of the standard of\nrationality and of the concession to irrationalism. Bartley has shown that there is no\nneed for the two moves, as one will do. This he proved conclusively: reducing the\nstandard of rationality renders a concession unnecessary. It is a shame that Popper\nhas not admitted this, suggesting instead that Bartley just improved the wording of\nwhat he had intended to advocate all along: he denied that he made the mistake that\nBartley had attributed to him. It is likewise a shame that Bartley conflated his valid\ncriticism of Popper with his own alternative to it: only the criticism, not the\nalternative to the criticized theory, is uncontestable. The errors on both sides led to an\nimpasse. In desperation, Bartley called Popper a fideist, and Popper took offence. My\naim here is to rectify these two errors and thus restore the peace between their ghosts.\nNow the fideism that Bartley has saddled Popper with is at the very least not\nthe traditional version but an improvement on it. It says, welcome critical scrutiny as\nprogressive. If this is a version of fideism, then it is an admirable version of it. Both\nPopper and Bartley have confused this idea, be it a version of fideism or not, with a\nslightly greater demand: do not advocate a theory unless it has passed critical\nscrutiny. This version of rationalism, be it fideist or not, both Popper and Bartley\nrejected, and rightly so, despite its superiority over the more traditional versions of\nfideism. Regrettably they did not praise it before rejecting it, although by the canons\nof criticism they should have.\nTaking for granted here the skeptical criticism of traditional rationalism, let us\nconsider the question, which modification of it is right? Considering any proposed\nmodification, why should we adopt it? To take it upon faith has all the defects of\nfideism without its advantage (of being a minimal concession). For the sake of the\nargument, let us agree to prefer the modification that is the smallest concession to\nirrationalism. What is it? And is that preferable to the original fideist view? And\nworse, how are we to adjudicate on this without begging the question? Still worse,\nwhatever answer to this question that we may offer, will it not remain fideist at heart?\nBartley acutely observed that when Popper said that his proposal (to takes the\nfaith in reason on faith) is a deviation from rationalism, he was in error (or at the very\nleast unclear): the deviation is from classical, not from critical rationalism: applied to\nitself, classical rationalism does not live by its own precepts (it begs the question);\napplied to itself, critical rationalism may live by its own precepts, at least possibly so.\nSo far this criticism of Bartley is obviously right, and Popper should have\nacknowledged its validity. Unfortunately this did not happen. Partly it was Popper\u2019s\nfailing, partly it was a confusion that rested on the fact that Bartley had his own view\nof critical rationalism that Popper had all the right to reject \u2013 but not before admitting\nthe validity of Bartley\u2019s criticism.\nFor my own part, I am no party to this dispute [Agassi, 1981, 72, 100, 465-71,\n474, 476]. My aim here is not to take sides but to clarify it and perhaps to remove the\nvery ground for it. I reject the framework within which it takes place. My alternative\nto that framework is the idea that rationalism is a working hypothesis. Thus it is\nneither a basis for rational thought nor an object of faith, but simply an assumption\nthat facilitate rational deliberations. It seems to me that on second thought both\nPopper and Bartley would have agreed. They could object that I have not said what\nrational deliberation is, but here I defer to their own views on it, which are quite\ntraditional and also sufficiently unproblematic to serve as the default option.\nMy effort to neutralize a dispute may sound like an exercise in the tradition of\nlogical positivism. It is not. For, it replaces a metaphysical framework with a better\none, and it does not destroy a problem but replaces it with a better alternative, much\nin the tradition of critical rationalism. Thus, needless to say, I ascribe my alternative\nto Popper and Bartley and take their input as either propaedeutic (preparatory) or the\nlong way around, as you like it.\n1. The hyper-stable working hypothesis\nWhat characterizes a working hypothesis most is its fluidity: there is no commitment\nand hardly any reason to it: its adoption is for a lark. One may even take it on a whim,\nthough on occasion it is common sense. And what one takes on a whim is ephemeral,\nof course. Still, some working hypotheses stay, for good reasons or bad. My concern\nis with a working hypothesis that is hyper-stable. So let me show first that these exist.\nMy claim is that this stability is the most general characteristic of any reasonable\nview of duty. So please be patient.\nWe act voluntarily yet under constraints. Classical liberal thinkers often said,\nin principle there is no difference between free and coerced action. Nevertheless, one\ndifference matters, between keenness and reluctance: we may act reluctantly out of a\nsense of duty. Of course, classical liberal thinkers viewed duty-bound conduct as not\npeculiar, as it is up to us to decide to behave morally, so that we always act\nvoluntarily. Nevertheless, the difference between the fulfillment of one\u2019s own\ninterest and that of others is a matter of principle. This is particularly so in cases of\nacts with unlikely consequences. When we face options that are not likely to yield\nfruits, we tend to adopt choices that are easiest: the game is not worth the candle, we\nmay say to ourselves and quit. Yet when the game is obligatory, this is unacceptable.\nMany moral acts are unlikely to have worthy consequences, yet were that a sufficient\nexcuse for quitting a task allows us to be socially apathetic and even asocial. When it\ncomes to affairs of other people and more so to public affairs, as the duty of hope we\nshould grant the Good Lord the benefit of doubt [Agassi, 1999, 50-4, 124-5]. In our\nown affairs we may be more realistic. Hence, whereas optimism as an opinion is\nfoolish, as an attitude it is just right and often even obligatory.\nThis is a peculiarity of action out of duty as opposed to one out of self-interest,\nand so classical liberal theory is wanting. Its error rested, indeed, on an optimist\nassessment of the outcome of the broad application of rationality: optimist\nassessments prevent the appearance of the difference in attitude that morality\nprescribes between satisfying the personal interests and those of others . World War II\nexposed this optimism as an error. It matters not whether the error was in the\nassessment of the ease with which rationality would be broadly applicable or in the\nassessment of its outcome. What matters is that the optimist assessment of the\noutcome of our actions is no longer the default option, and that it should stay\nnonetheless as an assumption for our actions \u2013 as a stable working hypothesis.\nA dreadful example for this is the conduct of the Jewish leadership, especially\nthe Zionist leadership in the United States of America during the Holocaust. They\nsabotaged efforts to rescue the Jews of Europe [Agassi, 1999, Ch. 15]. Now they say,\nthey knew these efforts were hopeless. This is a mere excuse, not only because\nrecords available now refute this assessment, but also and more so because a priori\nsuch assessments may be false. Still, admittedly, at the time the assessment was bleak\nand it was reasonable (though erroneous). This example may be poor. This is of little\nconsequence, since alternative examples are easily available.\nThe hypothesis that we may make a difference should serve as a hyper-stable\nworking hypothesis. It is my alternative to the ideas of Popper and of Bartley about\nthe choice of a theory of rationality. Let me explain.\n2. Between Classical Rationalism and Fideism\nThe starting point here, to repeat, is the admission of the skeptical criticism of the\nclassical theory of rationality: proof is impossible. Advocates of irrationalis m often\nuse this criticism as the rationale for their rejection of all theories of rationality and\nof all proposal and demand to behave rationally. Those who reject the classical\ntheory but wish to adopt another add some adjective to the name of the theory of\nrationality to differentiate it from a theory that they might endorse. The adjectives\noften used are &#34;traditional&#34;, &#34;classical&#34; and &#34;Cartesian&#34;; Karl Popper suggested\n&#34;comprehensive&#34;, since the classical version advocates the comprehensive demand to\naffirm no view ever except proven ones.\nBeing comprehensive, classical rationalism demands to jettison all of familiar\nideas, so that the learning venture should begin afresh with no assumptions, with a\nclean slate, and with utterly open minds. In brief, classical rationalism is radical.\nDescartes attempted to apply it in his celebrated thought experiment, performed in\nthe hope that starting afresh guarantees the establishment of a true, scientific image\nof the world. He failed, as did all of his disciples.\nThe classical theory of rationality bumps into two interlocking standard\nobjections. The first is the classical skeptical argument: proof is question-begging.\nAn obvious logical way to overcome this is by the admission of some sufficiently\nstrong initial basic axiom. The standard examples are, the principle of the simplicity\nof nature, or of limited variety, or of induction. Some other axioms are available as\nwell. Their adherents defend their choices with a new argument that exposes the\ncomprehensiveness of classical rationalism as further weakness: the principle,\nwhatever it is, requires the assumption that it suffices for the development of a\nrational worldview and of science as we know it. This added assumption repeatedly\nmeets with a refutation that exposes the proposed principle as not good enough.\nConsider then the opposite extreme: irrationalism. Its advocates recommend\ngiving up rationality; this fascinates those who find the irrational attractive, appealing,\noverpowering: they are tired of rationality. They are intentionally unreasonable,\nforgetting that the intellect is the most powerful instrument that Nature has put at the\ndisposal of humanity, and the refusal to use it is lamentable. The advantage of\nunreason, however, is that it is license for the use of poor arguments. Those who use\nthis license denounce logic as perverse, as opposed to human natural healthy instincts,\nor to tradition or to traditional religion, or to whatever else they may advance as\nsuperior to reason. Yet, as a mere working hypothesis, this reveals some interesting\nideas. Prominent among these is the view of the first irrationalist, Heraclitus, the\nfamous pre-Socratic thinker, who probably reacted to the first version of rationalism,\nthat of Parmenides. Plato's Socrates called irrationalists mysologists, the haters of\nlogic (Phaido). Despite this hatred Heraclitus offered some valuable criticism of\nrationalism and some new ideas. Nevertheless, here let us dismiss misology.\nIrrationalists need not giving up the use of the intellect. Its use does not require\nany recognition of it as an authority over all thought processes \u2013 it can be useful\nwithout being authoritative in any way. Hence, irrationalists may have a choice in\nspecifying what portion of their thought process the intellect is not to control, as long\nas the choice does not intervene with their ability to use logic, even with a vengeance,\nin areas deemed well within the province of reason, such as mathematics and physics\nand their practical applications. What then is the suggestion to limit rationality?\nWhere exactly does rationality cease to adjudicate? The irrationalist literature has\nmany answers to this question that serve well as merely working hypotheses.\nThe better of the disenchanted with classical rationalism distinguish between\nthe criticism of the classical theory of rationality that all of them endorse and the idea\non which they disagree as to what to place outside the domain of the intellect. They\nrightly insist that the latter is less important than the former, since it leads them to\nagree that some presupposition, no matter what, must obtain with no rational basis,\nno matter upon what other kind of basis it might rest; indeed, they may add, one may\nendorse quite arbitrarily any presupposition as the initial basic axiom for rationality.\nSome presuppositions are so useless that they are overlooked. (For example, the\nassertion that Superman exists will be obviously utterly useless here.) They\nadvocated arbitrary presuppositions are usually far from being satisfactory too, but as\nworking hypotheses they may be handy and when one fails its advocate may abandon\nit for another. Of course, being irrationalists they may also cling to it dogmatically.\nAn example of this dogmatism is collectivism, made popular by \xc9mile\nDurkheim, one of the two acknowledged fathers of modern sociology. Most\nirrationalists endorse collectivism dogmatically, despite its obvious defects; they take\nas their initial basic axiom tradition, religious or national, or some authority,\nintellectual or political, or any other item that they declare vital for the maintenance\nof social stability. Their basic axiom then is that society with no stability is too\nobjectionable to take seriously into consideration as a viable option. This is sad, but\nthere are sad options on the opposite side too, namely on the side of individualism.\nAs a stable working hypothesis this is very common in the social sciences. It is\nespecially popular as Max Weber, the other of the two acknowledged fathers of\nmodern sociology. He took as the initial basic axiom for rationality a personal faith.\nThis is the source of the label \u201cfideism\u201d (&#34;fideo&#34; means, I believe). Advocates of\nfideism stress the logical impossibility of rationalism as long as it is comprehensive,\nand the need to choose an initial basic axiom in order to reinstate it. Assuming\nnothing, one has no reason to activate the project of developing rationalism and a\nrational worldview. This is the so-called &#34;the tu-quoque argument&#34; (meaning, you\ntoo): comprehensive rationalism is impossible, therefore, rationalism too rests on an\ninitial basic axiom, namely, that rationality is at all possible and desirable.\nRather than ask, what did Weber use for proof, let us examine the tu-quoque\nargument. Supposing that it is valid; does this support fideism? Does it exonerate the\nutter arbitrariness (absence of logic) of the choice of an initial basic axiom? It does\nnot sound right. Most advocates of fideism believe in their tradition and Weber hated\ntradition and expressed faith in science. This observation is so obvious that we must\nascribe its neglect to its being taken for granted: of course, the initial basic axiom has\nto be sufficiently rich in content to enable it to save rationalism from its initial\npredicament. That we take this constraint for granted is obvious, yet the systematic\nneglect of its articulation is a remiss, since there is an obvious need to specify its\nfeatures and discuss them. Now, how should we decide whether our chosen initial\nbasic axiom is strong enough? Should it perhaps also be not too strong? And then,\neven if we find that our chosen axiom is strong enough but not too strong, then we\nmay ask, is it unique? If it is, then we can eschew fideism even in the light of the tu-\nquoque argument \u2013 as unnecessary: the constraint to classical rationalism imposed on\nit by the tu-quoque argument then leaves no room for any arbitrariness and it then\nbecomes eminently rational as the most efficient means to rescue rationality.\nThis move is very welcome, as it dispenses with the most undesirable corollary\nto fideism, namely, the claim that there are different and equally legitimate kinds of\nrationalism, depending on one's pre-logical choice of one's initial basic axiom, and\nthat the validity of each is constrained by its alternatives. What is said here may be\ntrue or false, but it is a way out of the predicament of classical rationalism that is not\nfideist in the usual sense of the word, as it employs the tu-quoque argument without\nconceding the arbitrary choice of any axiom.\nThe undesirable corollary just mentioned was praised by the great fideist and\nmystic anthropologist Sir Edward Evans-Pritchard as most desirable. This makes his\nfideism not so arbitrary. Any defense of the choice of an initial basic axiom will then\nbe rational. And then it is better to take as the initial basic axiom Russell's celebrated\nproposal.  Another proposal, perhaps even better, was introduced by Popper in\nChapter 24 of his classic The Open Society and Its Enemies of 1945: the belief that\ncriticism bespeaks progress. He called this &#34;the faith in reason&#34; and characterized it\nas the minimal required deviation from comprehensive rationalism. Russell hoped\nthat his a priori supposition would permit reinstatement of classical rationalism in\nsome attenuation; Popper offered a fully-fledged new theory of rationality as\ndisproof. If any suggestion for an initial basic axiom is acceptable, then a theory of\nrationality is possible such that it is neither classical nor fideist, and this regardless of\nwhether the proof or disproof is taken to be the criterion of rationality. The claim is\nthat the arbitrariness of the initial choice does not follow from the tu-quoque\nargument, so that it can be made quite rationally.\nIf classical rationalism is to be fully restored, however, it is not enough to\nqualify it rationally: proof has to be shown possible. If it is, then an example will\nestablish this possibility. Is there any? It is easy to adduce proofs, and even of diverse\nkinds, mathematical, scientific, and legal: for convictions in murder trials evidence\nshould establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and at times it is declared achieved.\nSkeptics and advocates of fideism admit that such proofs exist. The question is the\nsame as, would such proofs be acceptable to Descartes as valid? We do not quite\nknow what kind of proof would satisfy Descartes, and probably he himself did not\nknow that either. To restrict the discussion to mathematics will not do; he would not\nagree to this. Also, this would not help as controversy still surrounds the question,\nwhat are proofs in mathematics? Descartes did offer a criterion for valid proof, but it\nis unclear and by now abandoned. To be clear about what valid proof comprises, a\ntheory of proof is required. But then, naturally, whatever this theory will turn out to\nbe, it will be question-begging. It is this very observation that led to the ancient\nskeptic conclusion that proof is impossible. Hence [classical] rationality, too, is\nimpossible. So, the followers of Pyrrho, the Pyrrhonists, suggested that one should\nnever adopt any view, that one should always suspend judgment. Fideism is not any\nphilosophy that takes some initial axiom for granted: most philosophies do so.\nFideism is the endorsement of the skeptical critique of classical rationalism as\nlogically unassailable, plus the refusal to abide by the proposal to suspend all\njudgments or the observation that no one can follow this proposal. Advocates of\nfideism declare the only way out of skepticism the initial endorsement of some basic\naxiom prior to the acceptance of the rationalist canons of proof. Taking this last\nsentence seriously one may see that whether the proposals of Russell and of Popper\nare satisfactory or not, they have unquestionably rendered a great service by refuting\nthis fideist assertion: feasible or not, they show the existence of alternatives that are\nnot as arbitrary. They have thus sensitized us to the inconsistency of the advocates of\nfideism who defend their initial basic axioms, and even without stating them\nexplicitly.\n2. Between Fideism and Critical Rationalism\nThe question, which axiom to endorse, seems to advocates of fideism beside the\npoint: as the choice of an initial basic axiom is arbitrary in the sense that (for logical\nreasons) it is pre-rational and so not rational. Here some doubt as to the sincerity of\ncontrary notwithstanding.\nadvocates of fideism may be raised: how come they usually endorse the faith of their\nfathers, whatever this happens to be? They retort that this choice is the most\nconvenient. This sounds as if convenience is the supreme criterion of choice.\nMoreover, which choice is more convenient invites the investigations that they\nforego. One may try for comfort different initial basic axioms one after the other:\ntake as an initial axiom the thesis that repetition renders choice progressively\nintelligent and reasonable. This kind of conduct, and the decision to adopt it, is\nrational. The best variant of fideism, then, the one closest to the fideist own mode of\nreasoning, is to make a basic decision afresh each day. Advocates of fideism may\nreject this as it is inconvenient, but then, criteria for convenience as well as feels for\nit are no initial axioms and so they can be overruled. To conclude, even if fideism is\ntrue and an arbitrary choice of some initial axiom is required, it need not be final.\nSome existentialist philosophers say that a commitment to an initial axiom that is not\nlife-long is not serious. But to take seriousness as more compelling than intellectual\nprogress makes it one's initial basic axiom, and an inadmissible one at that, since it\nruns contrary to logic by blocking all criticism. Admitting this, however, demands\nthat every candidate for initial basic axiom should prove irrefutable.\nAdvocates of fideism ignore the range of choice of initial axioms to employ as\nthe basis of rational thought, possibly because most of them are traditionalists and\nonce they succeed to reconcile their traditional faith with rationalism they are content.\nIf so, then this is their initial basic axiom: they are traditionalists and rationalists. Is\ntheir choice arbitrary? Some of them endorse their traditions without examination;\nothers defend them in the name of social stability, and of these, Evans -Pritchard and\nothers, conclude that different traditions hold for different societies. They defend\nrationalism while rejecting the classical Cartesian hostility to tradition.\nAll this is conjecture, which is thus suspect, especially since finding any\nrationale to the fideist initial basic axiom deprives it of its arbitrariness and so of its\nvery fideism. But then, whenever advocates of fideism argue for their fusion of\ntradition and reason, they do so by defending their initial basic axiom \u2500 as arbitrary\nor otherwise \u2500 they are advocates of fideism no longer.\nMost non-religious advocates of fideism are pragmatists; they advocate faith in\nscience for practical reasons. This invites a careful distinction between pragmatists\nproper and pragmatist advocates of fideism: the former view usefulness as the basic\ncriterion for belief in any opinion; they deem utility the ground of belief: according\nto them rationality is not proof but usefulness. Hence, like Popper, they offer a non-\nclassical, theory of rationality and so they are not advocates of fideism at all. Hence,\nthe best criticism of pragmatism proper is the observation that in order to decide what\nidea is useful we need some workable criterion of rational decision between the\noptions that the choice of this or that hypothesis is most useful. Advocates of fideism\ndo not claim that utility or any other criterion is a criterion of rationality; rather, they\ntake it as the initial basic axiom that is chosen prior to being rational, as the\nprecondition for it; other than that, they adhere to the classical view of rationality as\nproof, and so the strong criticism of pragmatism just voiced does not apply to their\nview. One may, of course, suggest that the initial choice of rationality is not useful,\nbut this is an initial basic axiom, a dogma not subject to critical debate.\nToday taking science to be the most useful set of beliefs to advocate is\nextremely popular. Its popularity suggests that possibly behind it stands mental\nlaziness plus the hypothesis that following the majority is most convenient. This is no\nfideism. Nor is the thoughtless adherence to the majority view, nor is the view of one\nwho has never examined one\u2019s views and who does not know what exactly it is. It\nmay but need not be fideist proper. It is clear that these differ; the question is, does\nthis difference make a practical difference? A difference, to be a [real] difference,\nsaid arch-pragmatist William James, must make a [practical] difference. Is there a\npractical difference between pragmatism proper and pragmatist fideism?\nAt least this should be observed: the tu-quoque argument makes it clear that\nthose who use it view us all as advocates of fideism at heart, whether we know it or\nnot; and then even if everyone behave in the fideist manner, the advocates of fideism\nare still practically better off as they possess a greater self-awareness. But surely,\nwhether this is so or not is both forever question-begging and empirically decidable,\nwhich is absurd.\nPragmatists have replaced proof with utility as the criterion of rationality.\nOther criteria may be proof-substitutes too. Each of them may serve as an alternative\nto the classical theory of rationality or as a fideist basis for the quasi-classical one.\nThis depicts the whole scheme in a new way. For, now the question is generalized:\npragmatists or others who take utility or any other quality as their supreme criterion,\ndo they use it repeatedly and eschew proof proper, or do they use it initially and then\nrequire proof? Is theirs an alternative rationalist view or is it a quasi-rationalist one?\nThis is a big difference, as it is procedural and so it effects almost every deliberation:\ndeliberations may employ proof (though on the basis of an arbitrarily chosen axiom)\nand they may employ an altogether different criterion of rationality.\nThis reasoning may expose pragmatism as a version of fideism; it also exposes\nadvocates of fideism as rationalists for all intents and purpose, as long their initial\nbasic choice of rationalism is not challenged. Their discussions can, perhaps also\nshould, be scrutinized as to whether or not, in addition to their axioms, advocates of\nfideism usually advocate the demand for proof. Now, clearly, almost all discussions\nincorporate some initial hypotheses, except for Descartes' radical thought experiment\nand its alternatives, all of which are now judged unavoidably failures. Hence, there is\nno practical difference between the fideist mode of arguing and other, except for one:\nwhenever what they happen to consider their initial basic axioms happens to be\nchallenged, they refuse to discuss it. Here, all of a sudden, the tu-quoque argument\nbreaks down and drops out of the picture. Contrary to it, there is a basic difference\nbetween the fideist and others: we all exempt some dogma from the demand to\nexamine it rationally, but the advocates of fideism exempt their own dogma\nconsciously and systematically and for good. This is a great self-awareness, and one\nthat they might naturally take pride of. It turns out to be their awareness of their\nirrevocable commitment to a dogma, and as a necessity. But this turns out to be a\nmistake: there are better ways to handle the situation.\nThe very use of the tu-quoque argument rests on error: it is used as an excuse\nto exempt from rational scrutiny some unspecified view, on the basis of the\nobservation that usually we all do so (since the skeptic critique of classical\nrationalism is valid). But we all do so now and then, whereas advocates of fideism do\nso come-what-may. This is why the suggestion to keep one's initial axiom floating is\nso deadly to fideism; its hidden assumption is that their retreat to commitment is a\nleap of faith in the sense of Kierkegaard, as Bartley has discovered.\nBartley saw the situation this way: taking the tu-quoque argument as support\nfor fideism is placing it on the borderline between rationalism and irrationalism and\ninvites efforts to refute it: its refutation is required not for irrationalists but for\nrationalists. He was in error: the tu-quoque argument is but a variant on the skeptic\ncritique. Even were it unanswerable, it would remain better to take reason upon faith\nthan to be defensive about some proper dogma. This point belongs to Popper. It is\nlovely. In his effort to dodge Bartley\u2019s criticism he lost it. pity.\nThis is no defense of classical rationalism, of course, since the skeptic critique\nof it as question-begging is taken here as valid, even if only as a working hypothesis;\nthis is to dismiss the fideist critique as no boost for it. This dismissal holds equally\nfor classical rationalism and to any other variant. To make this evident, let us\nconsider the idea of the ancient Pyrrhonist school, the view that one can live w ithout\nadherence to any view, with total and permanent suspension of judgment, and that\nthe practice of the suspension of judgment provides peace of mind (ataraxia). This is\nquestionable, but let this ride and let us ask, is Pyrrhonism fideist? Possibly, as a\nmatter of fact, every school has an initial basic axiom. Even were this true, as neither\nschool has noted this, it is hard to decide which of the two schools is nearer to\nfideism, the Pyrrhonists or the classical rationalists. That there is a great practical\ndifference between them, however, is all too clear. Hence, the tu-quoque argument\nmakes no practical difference even between skeptics and classical rationalists, though\nthe skeptical argument clearly does.\nI know Popper and Bartle agreed that they d isagreed; I do not know on what.\nPerhaps Popper has offered a new comprehensive theory of rationality that is less\nquestion-begging than comprehensive classical rationalism, perhaps not; Bartley\nclaimed that he did and that Popper did not; but then perhaps both did and perhaps\nneither did. If both did, and if both did not, are the views of the two identical? For\nuncontested background information, the very demand for openness to criticism is\ntaken for granted. Popper\u2019s innovation that Bartley endorsed but that is still the\nminority view is the assertion that this demand suffices for rationality, including the\nrationality of science. Popper's theory of rationality is very far-reaching, and is far\nfrom obvious. Bartley found it admirable but defective in not being comprehensive.\n3. Between Popper and Bartley\nscience Adolf Gr\xfcnbaum who calls himself neo-Baconian and denies Popper his originality.\nWhereas classical rationalism broke down because it is comprehensive, fideism is\npainful because it is not. Hence, rejecting both amounts to rejectingwhat they share:\nthe idea that rationality is proof. Consider, then, critical rationalism, the idea that\nrationality is disproof. Can we not show both options of it, qualified and\ncomprehensive, likewise painful? Can we apply the skeptical argument to\ncomprehensive critical rationalism and find it wanting, and then to apply the\nrationalist critique of fideism to qualified critical rationalism, and then be done with\nit altogether? Let me defeat this program.\nConsider first the application of classical rationalism to critical rationalism\n(qualified or comprehensive). This way critical rationalism fails of course. This has\nbeen showed repeatedly in the literature, yet it is trivial. Moreover, this is offered as\nfatal criticism, yet it is no criticism at all: there is no reason why critical rationalism\nshould submit to the rules of classical rationalism. Should it be applied to itself\ninstead? That classical rationalism should be proven by its own light is clear. But\ncritical rationalism should be held open to criticism, perhaps, or else it should be\nqualified. Here possibly Popper and Bartley disagreed. What is the reasoning here?\nCan we discuss this matter without begging the question?\nThe claim that logic is obligatory is inherent in the history of the debate over\nrationality. Hence, it is not contested that the aim of criticism is to refute its object.\nFrom the very start Popper stressed that he never adjudicated the matter of the\nsuccess of each piece of criticism, that all he said in general was no more than what\nlogic requires: if and when a piece of criticism is judged successful, then it is thereby\nalso judged as having refuted its object. To repeat, Popper offers as a solution to the\nproblem of rationality not a logical truth, but a conjecture, the novel theory that\ndisproof suffices for the advancement of knowledge in general and of science in\nparticular. How does he know that disproof suffices? He does not; it is his conjecture.\nQuery: is it rational to advocate this presupposition, this initial basic axiom? Can\nthere be a critical debate of it? If not, it seems fideist; if yes, it seems comprehensive.\nWhich is it?\nAssume that we must choose some initial basic axiom; how can the choice be\nrational? Given Popper's theory of rationality as openness to criticism, the answer to\nthis question is obvious: to the extent that it is criticizable and open to criticism, it is.\nDoes this apply to Popper's own choice? Should a critical rationalist be open-minded\nabout being open-minded? This is hard to say. Let us try to do so by splitting critical\nrationalism into two theses, one minor, one major, so that the question splits into two\nas well. The minor thesis is that criticism is binding. Is it? In other words, is logic\nbinding? The major thesis is that disproof suffices for intellectual progress. Is it? Till\nnow adherence to logic was taken for granted; nevertheless, possibly, comprehensive\ncritical rationalism requires an examination of our commitment to logic.\nAlready Plato asked, how binding is logic? In the end of his Phaedo,\ndescribing Socrates' last minutes, he ascribes to him the refusal to give up reason;\nnothing, Socrates seems to say, will sway him away from logic: he will never be a\nmysologist: even in his last hour he will gladly accept criticism. It is hard to say\nwhether this reading of the text is right, since the question is intricate. But Popper's\ntext seemed to me clear enough \u2500 until he declared Bartley's reading of it erroneous:\nI then began to doubt my reading of his text. For a lark, however, let me cling to my\nold reading of his text, as examining a view is more important than its authorship.\n(Besides, the first author of qualified critical rationalism is anyway Plato or Heinrich\nHeine.) To avoid all misconception of my motive, let me repeat: this discussion is no\ndefense of Popper or of Bartley, since I dissent from both.\nPlato's insistence on open-mindedness, his refusal to be open-minded about it,\nseems to identify rationality with logic. This is not clear, especially since formal\nlogic was invented later, and since it was not satisfactory till the twentieth century, if\never. So logic was open to criticism. Is it still? If yes, can its authority be revoked? In\nother words, can there be a critical debate on the rationality of logic, and if it is found\ndefective, can it be taken for granted? This depends on what we mean by the demand\nto reject a refuted version of it. If it is the demand to improve logic, then yes; if it is\nthe demand to jettison it, then no. Hence, in the broad sense logic is not given to\nrational deliberations, and so it is the initial axiom of rationality. Yet, in the narrow\nsense logic is very much given to rational deliberations, and this is expressed in the\nperennial efforts to improve it. (This seems to be the major thrust of the critique of\nthe view of logic as above criticism that we usually ascribe to Van Quine.)\nThis holds for all possible versions of the theory of rationality, since, to repeat,\ndiscussion of it was always conducted within logic. And then, Popper's claim that\nrationality is not comprehensive can be seen (not as a concession to fideism but) as\nmaking explicit a point that was traditionally taken for granted and that the modern\nhistory of logic makes its explicit statement desirable: the broad commitment to logic\ninvites efforts at its improvement in detail. Once this is noted, the discussion of\ncomprehensiveness has to be recast in a more precise manner. For example, the\nadvocates of fideism' commitment to their tradition is less irrational if it is only a\nbroad commitment, while being open-minded about any detail of it. (This is no small\ndifference, as it replaces the refusal to engage in intellectual traffic between different\ntraditions with a proposal to have it, at least up to a point, but the point is movable.)\nPopper has advocated this attitude to tradition in his classic if neglected 1947\n&#34;Towards a Rational Theory of Tradition&#34; [Popper, 1963].\nWith more due care, then, Bartley's comprehensiveness may read, his\ncommitment to logic is rational since he is open to its critical assessment. The same\nholds for Popper, of course. Where, then, is the difference between qualified and\ncomprehensive critical rationalism? Perhaps the difference lies in the disagreement\nabout the major thesis, the thesis that the engagement in critical debates suffices for\nthe advancement of learning. Since criticism involves logic, the discussion of the\nmajor thesis involves the minor one, but we need not go over this ground again.\nSuppose that the thesis that criticism suffices for progress is refuted, then. What will\nthis suggest to critical rationalists? Again, it seems, it will invite an improvement, not\na total overthrow. This seems to be the attitude advocated and practiced by both\nattitudes. So how do they differ?\nThis is not an idle thought. Critical rationalism was criticized both ways: once\n\u2500 by Feyerabend and myself \u2500 with the observation that at times the suspension of\ncriticism (at least for a lark) is wise (as Popper admitted citing Galileo to that effect)\nand once \u2500 by myself \u2500 with the observation that scholasticism was critical but not\nprogressive. The reason for this defect is clear: scholastic criticism was conducted\nwithin a given framework that was not given to criticism; this was done consciously,\non the ground of the view that debates have to be limited by some initial basic axio m,\nvery much in the fideist manner. Popper was aware of this: in his early work he\ndemanded that the most theory most given to criticism should be examined first, and\nhe later criticized the scholastic theory, which he called &#34;the myth of the framework&#34;.\nHe was thus unclear if not inconsistent. The way to overcome the inconsistency is to\nspeak of maximal criticism instead of criticism when wording the thesis of critical\nrationalism. Popper suggested that the demand for maximal openness to criticism\nwill eliminate, or at least sufficiently prevent, the use of ad hoc hypotheses, as there\nreduce the level of openness to criticism of hypotheses.\nExcept that this was criticized too \u2500 also by myself. Many theories in\ntechnology are very open to criticism yet are very much ad hoc; efforts to put them to\ntest are made repeatedly, as they are of great technological value. Yet they are not\ndeemed intellectually as interesting as the scarcely testable theories that are on the\nforefront of theoretical research. Since critical rationalism does not differentiate\nbetween pure and applied research, it demands improvement. This holds for Popper\nand for Bartley equally.\nSince qualified critical rationalism demands openness to criticism not only in\nthe abstract but also as exhibited in the possibility of a concrete criticism, in the high\nrisk of the theory in question, Bartley could ask Popper, how great should this risk be\nbefore it is deemed great enough? Popper had an answer to this question already in\n1935, but only as far as science is concerned: the risk is measured there by the\nlikelihood of an experiment that can be designed and performed to refute the theory\nin question; this likelihood can be measured by some extant alternative or by\ncommon sense. But Popper himself admitted in 1945 that weaker kinds of criticism\nare possible, in history and in philosophy, including ethics. How much should the\nrisk be a real one? (Significantly, Bartley took seriously the weak criticism that\npseudo-intellectual sects directed against the established commonwealth of learning.\nHe suggested [Bartley, 1990, 100] that since the academy is so very dogmatic, these\nfleeting intellectual clusters are where the action really is. This view is intriguing but\nalas not serious.) Nor is that all. Popper spent much of his effort arguing that\ncriticism is beneficial, which should be incontestable, and that the theory of\nrationality as the critical attitude does not suffer from the skeptical critique. Bartley\non his part spent much time arguing that since critical rationalism is not hit by the\nskeptic critique it can be held comprehensively. But they both argued prematurely,\noverlooking the critical examination of the claim that they perform the task for which\nthey were designed.\nThe question that the classical theory of rationality came to answer is, what\ntheory should be believed? Critical rationalists refuse to answer this question, as it\nprefers the diversity of opinions. Rather, it comes to exclude the theories that are not\nreasonable to believe, beginning with traditional local myths. The wish to promote\nthe progress of science is better than the wish to believe in current science. Proof\ndoes not do it; does disproof? No; critical rationalism never guaranteed success. Can\nit at least explain success? No; explanation amounts to guarantee: to say that A is\ncaused by B is to guarantee the presence of A in the presence of B. Critical\nrationalism guarantees not the success in providing conjectures and their criticism,\nbut that when these are present, progress obtains. How? The answer is what makes\ncritical rationalism so very intriguing: criticism is not the cause of intellectual\nprogress; it is intellectual progress. This, however, is a new conception of progress,\nand it can be challenged. We have not shed light this way on an important matter:\nwhy is the Popper-Bartley dispute important? In answer to this Bartley said,\nerroneously, because the tu-quoque argument is a serious challenge. This challenge\nmay signify at most for critical rationalism, not for science proper.\n4. Rationality as Partial and as Social\nWe see again that the discussion requires better presentation. Let us begin with\nrationality, whatever it is. Rationality as proof is an all-or-nothing affair; criticism is\npossibly more graded. Consider it a matter of degree. I. C. Jarvie and I have\nintroduced this idea decades ago. The measure of the degree of rationality, we\nsuggest, is not some abstract scale but depends on the available intellectual tools. It is\nclear, we said, that for one living in a preliterate society the most rational act and\nattitude will be much inferior to that available to one living in a society familiar with\nscience. This enters the social dimens ion into the debate, and so it really needs going\nover and, when necessary, recast. This is no small matter. Traditionally the options\navailable to social philosophy were individualism and collectivism. As collectivism\nnaturally distrusts individual reason as disruptive, it tends to be irrationalist.\nIndividualism then ruled the debate on rationality. And as individuals depend on\nsociety to this or that extent, though not wholly, their rationality should be cast in\nsocial terms and then viewed as partial.\nTo take a simple example, whereas traditional advocates of fideism discussed\nthe matter of rationality in an individualist framework, they could hardly answer the\nquestion, how should I choose my initial axioms? They did not have clear instances\nof initial axioms, and it looked as if infinitely many alternatives are available. Asking\nthe question in a social manner it becomes the question of the choice of a community,\nand there are a few communities to join; moreover, one cannot change communities\nevery week, and so, for merely technical reasons, one must live on one so as to\nacquire is basic tenets. It was stressed by Michael Polanyi, that when one joins a\ncommunity one scarcely knows what it has to offer, especially if the community in\nquestion is the scientific community, and that when one learns the initial basic\naxioms one may find that they are not given to simple articulation. He stressed,\nhowever, that one can belong to more than one community without fear of\ncontradiction. He did not elaborate. Another historical example should serve as\nevidence of the defect of the abstract discussion that Popper still participated in: the\nold scholastic tradition is not considered as rational as the new scientific tradition\n(even on the supposition that the old gave birth to the young). I skip the details here.\nAs long as science plays the role of a paradigm of rational activity, the\nindividual is most rational when joining the scientific community. Popper has\nsuggested that science is a social institution, one that encourages criticism. He also\nsuggested that parliamentary democracy is such a paradigm, and the same holds for\nthat paradigm. That there may be inconsistency between science and democracy, as\nwell as within each, is no reason for defection, as it may be a challenge for efforts to\nimprove. Popper said, the reason for these being paradigms of rationality is that\nrationality is the effort to improve through criticism.\nCan we rephrase the Popper-Bartley dispute within a social framework? All\ntheories of rationality recommend joining actively the life of science and of\ndemocracy. The view of rationality as improvable goes better with critical\nrationalism than with classical rationalism. Is here a significant difference between\nPopper and Bartley? Can we rephrase Bartley's philosophy socially? I do not know.\nThe critical attitude commends both a personal openness to criticism and an\ninstitutional setup that encourages criticism and is open to reform. The criticism of an\ninstitution, or of an institutionalized opinion, however, is not the same as the\ncriticism of an individual's opinion: the one is a personal matter, the other is social.\nValid criticism should always lead one to the search of alternatives, and reform is\naccepted not after criticism is voiced and endorsed but after a viable alternative is\nfound and tested in instituted manners. What this means for Popper is clear enough:\nboth democracy and science are open to reform. What does this mean for Bartley\nabove and beyond what it means to Popper I cannot see. Perhaps this means that\npossibly democracy and/or science will be criticized in a new manner that will lead\nto a proposal of a totally new regime and/or research protocol and Bartley will be\nwilling to test it. Whether this is so or not is hard to say: the discussion becomes too\nabstract here.\nBibliography\nAgassi, Joseph, 1981.

 u"Michael S. Myslobodsky, ed.,\nThe Mythomanias: The Nature of Deception and Self -deception.\nHillsdale NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, 1996, pp. 23-50.\nDeception: A View from the Rationalist Perspective\nBy Joseph Agassi,\nTel Aviv University and York University, Toro nto\nSelf- Deception in General\n&#34;A Liberal Decalogue&#34; suggests (Russell, 1967, pp. 60-61) not\nto envy people who live in a fool's paradise: It is a place only\nfor fools. This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's\nparadise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of\nopinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down,\nthat reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when\nall is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of\ntheir situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to\nget them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is\nlittle that can be done about it, except that the wise would still\nprefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic\nmore constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the\nreassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable\nalternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - -\nso that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to\nmobilize some appropriate action.\nAlternatively, fools may tell themselves that there is no risk.\nThis is self- deception, and the question is, why do people\ndeceive themselves and take risks? To take a concrete\nexample, people with weak hearts may avoid taking precautions\nand prefer to live like normal people and risk instant death\nfrom heart failure. This is possibly a rational choice. Yet some\nwho suffer from weak hearts pretend, even to themselves, that\nthey are normal. It is hard then to say whether they have\nchosen to live normally and take the risk. Perhaps they prefer\nto take precautions, and yet do not do so because they are\nunable to look the risk straight in the face.\nMore sophisticated ways of living in a fool's paradise are\nknown. One may live there knowingly. One may feel that one\ndoes not share the reassuring received opinion, yet pretend\nthat one does. This is what Russell warned against: Anyone\nwho knowingly chooses to live in a fool's paradise is still a fool.\nAnyone who thinks that awareness of one's living in a fool's\nparadise immunizes one to its dangers is a fool. This is self-\ndeception about one's ability to cope with deceit. Many\nphilosophers have noted that people who habitually deceive\nfinally fall for their own deceptions. This is the well-known\nphenomenon that confidence artists appeal to the willingness of\ntheir victims to deceive both themselves and others in one and\nthe same act: The victims are encouraged to deceive\nthemselves into thinking that they deceive only others while\nignoring their own greed and the immorality of the way they\nchoose to satisfy it. To this Russell added that the same holds\ntrue for all self -deception: Those who think they can live in\nsituation of self-deception without deceiving themselves finally\nfall for their own self-deception. The seemingly wise deceive\nthemselves that they only pretend that they endorse the\nreassuring hypothesis: They do not know the cost of the\npretense, which is the neglect of thinking out the viable\nalternatives.\nThe reason one endorses the reassuring hypothesis despite\nattempts to immunize oneself is complex. It is in part\nintellectual: One does not invest in the examination of\nalternative hypotheses. It is in part social: One cannot discuss\nalternative possibilities when one pretends to the world that\none is committed to the reassuring hypothesis. It is in part\npsychological: One is ambivalent about matters, and one\nreassures oneself that one does not need the reassurance.\nThe case of self- deception, in brief, is complex. It involves\nerror, impatience in thinking out detailed matters,\nunwillingness to examine each and every obvious option, and\nalso deception proper. Yet clearly something is missing here: It\nis fear and obsession. As Freud was first to notice, self-\ndeception usually rests on the stubborn reluctance to consider\nalternatives when these are suggested by others.\nNot all cases of self -deception, however, are cases of life in\nfool's paradise. This phenomenon is usually associated with the\nself-deception that involves whole social groups. The social\ncase is more complex than the personal case. The personal\ncase of self -deception is puzzling because its victims refuse to\nconsider corrections suggested by their environment. The case\nof the fool's paradise that is group self -deception, usually\nnational, is different and more complex: A whole society\ndeclares a certain option not open to public discussion. Its\ngiven rationale is that it is dangerous to discuss different\noptions -- because it will help other people or discourage our\npeople. Indeed, it is very similar to the case of the confidence\nartist: The group (national) leadership suggests that, although\nour case may be shaky, we may be able to succeed if it will be\nnevertheless accepted, and for this it should be presented with\nfull confidence. All that is missing from the picture to complete\nit are two true observations. First, many political leaders are\nconfidence tricksters, and they see themselves as such.\nSecond, confidence tricksters make a profession of deceiving\nthemselves that they deceive only others. In principle, the n,\nthe difference between the two cases -- the private and the\npublic -- is only technical: Both are cases of reluctance -- of\nnot allowing oneself to examine views that deserve to be\nexamined, where an excuse for this reluctance is left\nunexamined as well . The two cases differ as to the excuse\noffered for the reluctance. To make the difference purely\ntechnical, what is needed is to observe, as is explained in detail\nhere, that any effort to present a case authoritatively -- be it\npersonal, social, politica l, or intellectual -- is in itself nothing\nshort of self-deception.\nIn summary, when one deceives oneself, one does not know the\ncost of the self -deception, and it is usually this that makes the\nerror significant. In other words, however irrational any c ase of\nself-deception looks, when one unpacks it, one finds it not very\nproblematic. The inability to see this rests on a difficulty that\nenters the picture with the introduction of a theory of\nrationality. Two important theories of rationality are found in\nWestern philosophy. The earlier of the tow is the more\nimportant. It was known as the rationlist theory, and now it is\nknown as classical rationalism. It identifies rational action with\none based on rational belief and rational belief as that which\nrests on proof of sorts (Agassi, 1986a; Agassi &amp; Jarvie, 1987,\nChapter 16.) The other important theory is romanticism: It\nidentifies rational action with one based on strong intuition:\nOne acts rationally when one is true to one's inner self, when\none listens to the right inner voice. This theory, be it true or\nfalse, is not given to rational discussion for the following\nreason. There is only one argument against it: By listening to\none's inner voice, one can make tragic decisions. The followers\nof the romantic theory of rationality are not dissuaded by this\nargument for reasons that are good or bad. Whatever is the\ntruth of the matter, the followers of the romantic theory are\nunshakable. Hence, there is no point in pursuing this discussion\nunless and until someone comes up with a new suggestion (for\ndetails see Agassi, 1982).\nThe rest of this chapter is devoted to a discussion of the\nclassical theory of rationality and of its implications for the\ncase of self -deception. At the end, a new avenue for the theory\no f rationality is highlighted. The newer theory of rationality is\nmore commonsensical, as it takes rationality to be a matter of\ntrial and error. Thus, it permits the discussion to proceed along\nthe lines suggested here.\nRationality and the Social Order\nThe prevalence of self -deception is part of folk knowledge; it is\nthe target of a rich folk literature, and of more sophisticated\nliterature as well. It has not puzzled people, however, until the\nadvent of modern times. The reason is not far to seek: The\nphenomenon began to puzzle people when it conflicted with\nreceived opinion and/or when it constituted a challenge that\nwas surprisingly hard to meet. The surprising difficulty\npresented by a challenge testifies to the presence of a theory\nin the light of which it should be easily met. The theory that\nhuman beings are rational is the source of the trouble:\nObviously, self -deception is not rational.\nAs long as the received opinion was that human beings are\nfoolish, or unreasonable, it was expected that they sho uld\nbehave erratically, deceive themselves, and so on. Clearly, this\ntraditionally received opinion was an unavoidable corollary to\nthe traditionally received religious doctrines of the Western\nworld prior to modern times: The wages of sin are slight and\nmomentary and the cost of sin is eternal damnation; Hence\nnothing is more rational than to behave properly. Yet people\nwill sin (&#34;the flesh is weak&#34;). The prevalence of sin was taken\nby all the traditionally received religious doctrines of the\nWestern world prior to modern times as conclusive evidence of\nhuman irrationality.\nThe situation was taken quite differently by most of the modern\nrationalistic philosophers, the classical rationalists: They\nconsidered the prevalence of sin to be evidence that sinners\nsimply do not believe in eternal damnation. They reasoned\nthus: Rational people act in accord with their beliefs; people do\nnot act in accord with the belief that their actions will lead to\neternal damnation; hence, clearly, they do not believe in\neternal damnation. Moreover, the classical rationalists taught\nthat it is important to hold the right beliefs. To this end, beliefs\nshould be adopted rationally, and then all will be as well as can\nbe expected. Self-deception, however, does not fit the classical\nrationalist prescription: Classical rationalists always viewed it\nas the willful deviation from rational belief. Its prevalence,\nthen, is, or seems to be, a refutation of their theory of rational\nbelief. Hence its centrality for their theory of rationality -- for\nthe theory of rationality presented in the classical rationalist\ntradition (Agassi, 1977, 1991).\nThis last point deserves a slight elaboration. Practically all\nWestern religious traditions and practically all folk wisdom\nconstantly preach the restraint of natural human appetites on\nthe ground of the (false) observation that selfish conduct\nobviously undermines social stability. The classical (Western)\ntradition of rationalist philosophy disagreed with this teaching\nand rejected this observation (as obviously the very opposite of\nthe truth). It declared any desirable restraint better achieved\nby reasonable, self- reliant individuals than by those frightened\nby hell fire and brimstone. Classical rationalists preferred, on\nthe whole, not to prescribe restraint. They did not deny that\nsome restraint is reasonable. Yet they considered particularly\nerroneous the demand to avoid greed and selfishness. The\nreasonable, self- reliant individual, they taught, will practice the\nnecessary self- restraint anyway. The end of rational conduct is\nalways selfish, as action comes to satisfy the natural appetites\nof actors. Hence, the best way to act, the best way to achieve\none's end, is to behave intelligently - - to act as a reasonable\nself- reliant individual (Agassi, 1 986b).\nIn brief, the classical (Western) tradition of rationalist\nphilosophy rejected as too strict the preaching of (Western)\nreligious traditions and folk wisdom for the restraint of natural\nhuman appetites. Its preached reasonable self- reliance, on the\nopposite view that reasonable, self- reliant individuals are\nbetter able to judge how strict their conduct should be.\nRational action is best guided by thought; Hence, the problem\nof rationality is less a question of the choice of a mode of\nconduct and more the question of the choice of the right belief\nto endorse. The problem then can be limited, at least initially,\nto rational belief.\nThe 17th- and 18th-century rationalist philosophers were\nliberals. They learned to argue against the traditional religio u s\nrequirement for strictness, which was based on the observation\nthat the unintended social consequences of selfish action are\nsocially undesirable. The liberal philosophers suggested, on the\ncontrary, that some social conditions ensure that the\nunintend ed social consequences of selfish action are socially\ndesirable. Under such conditions, then, following natural\nappetites, selfish actions will (unintentionally) support social\nstability rather than undermine it. If so, instead of preaching to\ncurb natural human appetites by the threat of hell fire and\nbrimstone and eternal damnation, it is wiser to create\nconditions that will make selfish conduct socially beneficial:\nThe readiness to act selfishly is more reliable than the\nreadiness to curb selfish motives merely out of fear (Gellner,\n1992, 1995, p. 8.)\nInitially, in the 17th and 18th centuries, the theory of\nrationality was prescriptive rather than descriptive. It became\ndescriptive in the 19th and 20th centuries, with the advent of\nmodern social science . It was recognized then that it is well\nworth investigating the facts of the matter, to observe what\nactions some extant ideas bespeak, and how. This created a\nneed to distinguish explicitly between the two kinds of\nrationality: (a) the intellectual ratio nal choice, the choice of\nbeliefs or of opinions to endorse; (b) the practical rational\nchoice, the choice of the right conduct. This distinction is\nbriefly denoted as the choice between rational thought and\nrational action, or that between thought and action. The need\nto make this distinction explicit was first presented in modern\nsociology. It usually goes by the name of Max Weber, one of\nthe acknowledged fathers of that field, who made his studies at\nthe end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th cent uries.\nNow the classical rationalist assumption is that action is guided\nby thought, and rationally this is done as best as possible.\nHence, the problem of rationality can be limited, at least\ninitially, to the problem of rational thought: What opinions\nshould one endorse? What is rational to believe in? What\ncriterion of choice of a belief should one endorse? The best\nsolutions to these questions, the classical rationalists taught,\nwill ensure the best solutions to all problems.\nRationality and Self- reliance\nQuestion: why did the classical rationalists find it so important\nto insist that, by the classical rationalist recipe, all is as well as\ncan be expected?\nAnswer: Because throughout the history of classical\nrationalism, its adherents have opposed the re ligious doctrine\nthat humans are evil and replaced it with the classical\nrationalist gospel of self- reliance as the road to salvation\n(Agassi, 1977).\nQuestion: If all is as well as can be expected, why is the world\nstill so frustrating, why are people so d isappointing as they\nare?\nAnswer: Because, says the classical rationalist, people are still\nnot self- reliant.\nQuestion: Why are people not self -reliant? What will make them\nso?\nAnswer: People are not self- reliant, says the classical\nrationalist, because they are captives of the [religious]\ndoctrines which they are taught, which makes them rely on\ntheir teachers. Only giving up these doctrines will enable\npeople to become self-reliant. After the act of giving up\nreceived opinions, beliefs will be as rational as can be expected\n(for more details see Agassi, 1991). The world may still not be\nperfect even when people will be as rational as possible, but it\nwill be as perfect as possible. This is the classical theory of\nrationality: Rational conduct will bring about the best of all\npossible worlds, says the classical rationalist, particularly\nbecause it will advance scientific research, and thus increase\nself-knowledge and self -reliance.\nIt was in this way that self -deception was integrated into the\nbroader system of the modern or classical rationalist\nmovement, or of the Enlightenment movement, or the moderns.\nSelf- deception, they taught, is irrational, and irrationality is\ndue to the absence of self- reliance, and this absence is due to\nlies with which one is ra ised. Members of this movement were\nhardly ever explicit about religion. Few of those who were\nreligiously skeptic dared hint at that fact. It only became\npermissible to refuse to assume the existence of God in the\nearly 19th century, after the demise of t hat movement, and\neven then there was no attack on established religion until the\nmid -19th century. Nevertheless, this much is clear: The\nundercurrent of the gospel of Enlightenment was that of self-\nreliance; the educational system was blamed for teaching ideas\nthat impede it. The education system was, of course, run and\ncarefully monitored largely by the religious establishment. In\nthe civilized world, this monopoly was broken by the French\nand American Revolutions, yet the monitoring of it by the\nreligious establishment still goes on there to this day. However,\nfew will blame the religious establishment for the widespread of\nirrationality.\nThe situation merits careful analysis. The basic classical\nrationalist tenet is this: Self -reliance is the reliance on reason;\ntherefore it is the same as rationality. It follows from this that\nself- reliance, or rationality, is the best guide to life. There is\nno substitute for thinking: Regardless of whether one is\nreligious, it was suggested, one should not rely on any church\nor leader. Some modern rationalist philosophers preached and\nstill preach religious self- reliance, of course (&#34;God helps those\nwho help themselves&#34;). Yet it was this idea that undermined\nthe authority of established churches and leaderships,\nregardless of whether and to what extent this authority was\nhostile to self -reliance.\nThe question then is, what is rationality? It was treated in a\nstandard way within the classical rationalist tradition, and its\ncurrent formulation is as follows. The question is first split into\ntwo: What is rational action? What is rational belief? The\nclassical rationalist tradition took it for granted that people\nalways act in accord with their beliefs; Otherwise they are\ncoerced by others, by the laws of the land, or by the laws of\nnature, and so they do not act freely, and so they do not really\nact. This is the distinction between action and behavior that\nentered the literature. (Behaviorism, accordingly, is the view\nthat people never act in this sense of the word -- tha t they are\nalways coerced to move as they do by the combination of the\ngeneral laws of nature and specific circumstances. The standard\nclassical rationalist view rejects this doctrine and takes for\ngranted as a fact the repeated observation that people do act.)\nAssuming, then, that people act, it follows that they act\nrationally. It then follows that if their beliefs are rationally\nheld, then their conduct is as good as can be reasonably\nexpected. This seems reasonable, and even commonsense. It is\ncommonsense, of course, only on the supposition that humans\nare naturally rational and self- reliant, that irrational conduct is\ndue to childhood indoctrination in unreasonable beliefs, and\nthat this indoctrination can be overcome for the asking. This\nmeans that peo ple are rational unless they are deceived. Why,\nthen, do people insist on being deceived? Why are people\ngullible? Classical rationalism offers no answer. This is the big\ngap in the classical rationalism of the Enlightenment\nmovement. This doctrine is still very popular, and so the gap is\nstill conspicuous.\nThus, the prevalence of self- deception is the major refutation\nto the doctrine of natural human rationality which is at the root\nof the doctrine of the Enlightenment movement. Moreover, all\ndeception is due to the fact that some of it is successful, and\nsuccessful deception is possible only because many people\nallow themselves to be deceived. Why do they? Because they\ndeceive themselves about other people's credibility. Admittedly,\nsince rational opinio n is at times erroneous, one may be\ndeceived without self-deception. Yet, since reason is the best\nguide, if the rationalist philosophy is true, it will prevent\nconstant systematic error. Systematic error is the result of\ninsistence on it, of the mistrust of reason, and so it is due to\nself-deception. Even the trust in the teaching and\nindoctrination during childhood is a form of self -deception. It is\npossible and rationally obligatory to give it up and be set free.\nYet people often cling to their education. They deceive\nthemselves to trust it. The question that classical rationalism\nhas to answer is, why then do people allow others to deceive\nthem systematically? According to classical rationalism, what\nprevents bridging the gulf between the best, which is the life of\nreason, and the real, which is the practice of systematic error,\nis self- deception alone. This phenomenon deserves special\nattention: It is any systematic error that cannot be viewed as\nanything other than self- deception: All effort to correct it are\nmet with unintelligent excuses.\nError and Sin\nThe ethics of the Enlightenment movement, of the modern\nphilosophy of life, is simple: &#34;Reason is and ought only to be,\nthe slave of the passions&#34;, as David Hume has aptly put it\n(Hume, 1980, Bk. 2, Pt. 3, Sec. 3). On this view, self- interest\nis the only right motive force for action, provided it employs\nreason to the full, which, of course, is eminently reasonable.\nHence, all sin is violation of self -interest, and so, at bottom, all\nsin is error. This is the doctrine of enlightened self-interest. It\nis scarcely new. In antiquity it was known as the Socratic\ndoctrine of eudaimony ('eu' is good and 'daimon' is spirit; the\nname refers to the story, narrated in Plato's The Apology of\nSocrates -- Socrates explains that he is the wisest by reporting\nthat he has a good Fairy Godmother who prevents him from\ndoing what he does not want to do, which is not good for him).\nThis doctrine is particularly hard to defend, since experience is\nmore in accord with the opposite doctrine, according to which\nhumans are both wicked and self-destructive. Thus, the moral\ndoctrine of classical rationalism appears to be empirically\nrefuted.\nThe rejoinder to this criticism comes in two steps. The first\nmove is to reduce all self -des truction to self -deception -- on\nthe supposition that as self -destruction hurts oneself, it is\nnever desirable and so it is never reasonably desired. (It is\nunnatural.) The second move is to reduce wickedness to self -\ndestruction. The way to effect this last reduction is to show\nthat the wicked are sawing the branch on which they sit. This is\nshown by the claim that, as their need for friends requires they\nshould be benevolent not wicked. This is unsatisfactory, as it\nmay work for friends, perhaps even for p otential friends too,\nbut not ever for enemies. It looks eminently reasonable to be\nvicious to them. Then different arguments are marshaled. An\nappeal is made to providence: It is in one's best interest to be\non good terms with divine powers. This, too, is unsatisfactory,\nas it is an appeal to the wishes of the divine, not to those of a\nself- reliant actor. The holders of the monopoly on divine\npowers always oppose self- reliance. An appeal may then be\nmade to one's need for peace of mind, and hence for peace\nwith one's conscience (he conclusion of Hume, 1980, explains\nmartyrdom this way). This, too, is unsatisfactory: Conscience is\nbased on religion, and the exercise of eudaimony was initially\nintended to do away with it, and for good reasons: Clearly, it is\nnot conscience, but the sense of guilt, that disturbs the peace\nof mind. This sense of guilt is forcibly established by religious\neducation to undermine self- reliance. All advocates of self-\nreliance recommend that the sense of guilt be eradicated\n(Kaufmann , 1973; Agassi &amp; Agassi, 1985).\nIt is still possible to defend the doctrine of eudaimony, or\nenlightened self- interest: Self -destructive action is prevented\nby the sufficiently clear understanding of its consequences. The\nstandard contemporary example is smoking, but any bad habit\nwill do. The victims of a bad habit know that their conduct is\nnot in their self- interest, but only in a vague manner: They\noften refuse to see it clearly until their physician convinces\nthem that they are killing themselves. Then many of these\npeople find themselves freed of their bad habit with no effort at\nall. Hence, the intensified energy and sense of guilt invested in\nefforts to stop a bad habit are forms of self -deception: What is\nneeded is not effort nor strong will, but clear understanding of\nthe harm it causes, say the sages of the Enlightenment.\nAs it happens, all this is neither here nor there. Whatever the\nrule is for right behavior, it is clear that self-deception is not\nthe right mode of conduct, yet it is prevale nt. Even the\nassumption that all wickedness is due to self-deception does\nnot help vindicate humanity very much, since self- deception is\nevidently wicked: The pure at heart will hardly fall for it.\n(Others are guilty of the sin of pride.) Hence, regardless of\nwhether one should be as fully self- reliant as possible, and\nwhether the canons of right conduct are those of enlightened\nself- interest, self-deception is both erroneous and sinful, yet it\nis regularly practiced. Why? In particular, is it the sin of it that\nbrings about the error, or is it the other way around?\nBefore we proceed, we may wish to know, what does it matter?\nImperfection is a familiar fact, as are both wickedness and\nstupidity. Why does the old party insist that all impropriety is\nsin, an d why does the new party insist that all sin is error? Why\nnot lump them together, or say that impropriety and\nmisconduct are at times due to error and at other times due to\nsin (and often due to both)? After all, criminal law says exactly\nthis: Criminal c ourts are often called to adjudicate and decide\nabout the reason for some misdeed - - is it due to sin or to\nerror? Moreover, such courts also distinguish between\npermissible and impermissible error. (This is the root difference\nbetween murder, premeditated or not, and involuntary\nmanslaughter or accidental killing.) Why insist on reducing\nerror to sin or the other way around?\nThe answer is this: Suppose that behind every sin lurks some\nerror. The way to reduce sin is then not by preaching, but by\nenlighte ning. This is the explanation that historically stood\nbehind the Enlightenment movement's optimistic view of\nhumanity: Sinfulness is allegedly a part of human nature,\nwhereas ignorance certainly is not. But this is questionable:\nJust as one may say that be hind every sin is error, one may\nalso say that behind every error is sin. Ignorance leads to\nexcusable error only, whereas the error of people's ways are\ndeviations from the straight and narrow. Established religion\ncomes to prevent sin, and it teaches the true doctrine, but\npeople who are wicked will not listen. Thus, according to all\nestablishments that issue rules of proper conduct, self-reliance\nis the cardinal sin. (Hence, science can have no such\nestablishment! This is conspicuously false, yet in the Age of\nReason, in the time when classical rationalism flourished, it\nwas much more reasonable than it is today to assume that\nscience has no establishment whatsoever.) Here, again, we\nmeet the source of the disagreement: It is this question --\nwhat is bett er to rely on, individual self- reliance or traditional\nwisdom?\nThis does not solve the problem at all. The fact remains that\nboth morality and science are cultivated. Why try to eliminate\none of these? The answer is that one depends on the other:\nWisdom, says established religion, begins with the purity of\nheart (&#34;the beginning of wisdom is the fear of God&#34;); ethics,\nretort the enlightened, begins with the intelligent employment\nof reason. Does this dispute matter? Should it not be ignored\nand both morality and reason be employed?\nAll this will still not do. This discussion is stuck with the\nproblematic phenomenon of self -deception; it is admittedly\nboth stupid and wicked; It is better eradicated, but no one\nknows how. Even the combined use of both expla ining and\npreaching does not overcome it, and so there is a genuine need\nto learn more about it so as to cure it. The two common\ntheories identify it as a sin as well as an error, yet they differ\nas to which one is the source of the other. Which is it then? In\nthe hope of finding a better cure, a better understanding of\nself-deception may be sought. In this search, attempts may be\nmade to criticize both theories.\nBacon's Doctrine of Prejudice\nThe present discussion has got into a loop as sin and error are\nreducible to one another: Even if all error/sin is sin/error, it\nseems that the very disposition to err/sin lies in our\nmoral/intellectual imperfection. All humans are disposed to\nboth sin and error, and it is hard to decide which of the two\ndispositions lies deeper. Moreover, as this discussion concerns\nself-deception, it is important to note possibly self -deception is\ninexplicable even were it known if error is the cause of sin or\nvice versa. The curious historical fact is that the presentation\nof the problem was first forcefully made by Sir Francis Bacon,\naround the year 1600. He solved it not by any attempt to\nchoose between blaming sin for error and blaming error for sin\nbut by blaming self-deception for both. He was not concerned\nwith the question, which comes first, sin or error? He was not\nconcerned with social and political philosophy. He had a\ntremendous vision: A great scientific revolution is in the offing,\nand it will bring about a great technological revolution. He was\nconvinced that most social and political problems would be\nsolved by the technological revolution. Until then, he\nrecommended, a conservative attitude to politics should\nprevail.\nAs Bacon was convinced that technology would be\nrevolutionized by the development of scientific knowle dge\nproper, his sole concern in most of his writings was to help the\nadvancement of learning (for a detailed discussion of all this,\nsee Agassi, 1988b). Bacon took for granted the ancient doctrine\nof how enlightenment comes about: The pure mind is prepared\nto perceive the truth in an intuitive experience of sorts. This\ndoctrine is generally known all over the world as mysticism\n(see Agassi, 1981b, Chapter 23). There is much confusion here:\nThe mystics proper do not claim that their knowledge is given\nto cle ar articulation, yet the Platonic and Aristotelian theories\nof learning do. Hence, these theories are not quite mystical;\nthe neo -Platonic or cabalistic doctrines are mystical. The\ncentral question that this raises is, how is the mind purified? It\nengaged Bacon as it engaged many others before and after\nhim. (Different mystics have offered different rituals for this\npurpose.) Everybody agrees, of course, that, to that end, the\nmind has to be of a righteous man -- free of error. The\nquestion remains, how is the mind of cleansed of its errors?\nBoth Plato and Aristotle recommended critical debate as the\nmeans to that end. (Aristotle called this method 'epagoge', and\nthis word was translated into 'induction'.) It is the method of\nquestioning that ends up with de finitions, said Aristotle, as\ninvented by the Pythagoreans and perfected by Socrates and\nPlato. Definitions are the foundations of science, Aristotle\nadded, and they constitute the source of all true knowledge.\nBacon agreed about all of this except for the ancient view of\nthe efficacy of critical debate.\nCritical debates, said Bacon, have gone on in universities for\ncenturies, yet to no avail: Each party sticks to its guns. The\nreason is simple: One can always ignore criticism, or dismiss it\nwith a wittic ism (&#34;this is an exception that proves the rule&#34;),\nor, if one is obliged to take account of it, one can make a new\nsubtle distinction, to make a small exception, or otherwise\nbelittle the worth of an argument.\nThis raises two central questions. First, is it always possible to\nbelittle criticism? Second, why should one do that? The answer\nto the first question is in the affirmative. It is a powerful part\nof logic, known today as the Duhem-Quine thesis. Exceptions\ncan always be classified in a different category. (To take a\ncommon example, the prejudiced who recommend the\ndiscrimination of any sort of people may admit that an instance\nof the sort in question is unjust; they will then place these\ncounterinstances in a separate class and cling to their prejudic e\nagainst the remaining members of the discriminated sort. For\nmore details about the Duhem-Quine thesis see Agassi, 1994.)\nThere are different attitudes to criticism. Duhem said science\nmust accept criticism only in small doses so as to maintain its\nco ntinuity. Why should science do that? Duhem did not explain,\nbut the truth is that he was defending the same medieval\nmethod that Bacon was attacking because he greatly respected\nthe same medieval thinkers Bacon despised. Bacon declared\nthem enemies of pro gress; Duhem declared their contributions\nessential to the history of science. Bacon denied the very\nexistence of mediaeval science; Duhem was its first great\nhistorian. More important, Bacon agreed with the ancient\nrevered philosophers that total scientif ic knowledge of the\nwhole universe is possible; Duhem did not. Bacon declared the\nneed for one and only one scientific revolution -- the one that\neradicates all prejudice and all error; Duhem advocated\ncontinuity and denied the possibility of scientific re volutions.\nBacon envisaged a tremendous explosion of science; Duhem\ntaught that science proceeds in small steps. Bacon ignored\nmathematics altogether and recommended for the mind free of\nprejudice to collect as many and diverse observations of simple\nfacts as possible, and to proceed slowly and carefully towards\nthe goal of total scientific knowledge; Duhem saw this as naive\nand insisted on the need to develop the mathematical\napparatus that is essential for scientific knowledge and fitting\nthe facts within it.\nHow is one to judge between these views? Probably most\npeople will reject both, at least because at least two scientific\nrevolutions have occurred, contrary to both. Bacon was too\nradical in his demand to clean the slate with no theory left and\nDuhe m was too conservative in his claim that science suffers no\nrevolution as each stage of it depends on a previous stage\n(Agassi, 1957, 1963, 1981b. See also the biography of Duhem,\nJaki, 1984).\nBacon was a Utopian visionary in the style of his time -- the\nearly 17th century. He based his vision on a new idea: He\nassumed that the rejection of all preconceived opinions and the\naccumulation of a vast collection of items of factual information\nwill lead rapidly to the full growth of theoretical science.\nFurthe r, he was deeply convinced that this growth will bring\nsalvation, and that salvation is around the corner because\neveryone is naturally disposed to contribute to the growth of\nknowledge (Bacon, 1994, Bk. I, Aphorisms 15 -18). Why, then,\nis salvation not here already? Because there is a small obstacle\nto it: The sins of laziness and pride. People offer conjectures\ninstead of working hard in the search for the truth, and then\nthey refuse to admit criticism as it puts them to shame. Thus,\nthe demand for the purity of mind includes the demand for\ndevotion and humility, caution and resistance to the temptation\nto conjecture. Once one has made a conjecture, one sees the\nworld as conforming to it, is then bound to endorse it as true,\nand is then trapped in it: It be comes a fixed feature of one's\nintellectual makeup. (This is corroborated by contemporary\ncognitive theory: One who endorses the theory that all is x, say\ncognitive psychologists, sees x everywhere; x can be atoms,\nlife, sex, selfishness, or anything else.)\nPrejudging matters instead of letting facts speak for\nthemselves, Bacon explained, is the acceptance of a bribe. His\nexplanation is subtle, and reminds one of what the Bible says\nof it (Exodus, 23:8): Bribery blinds the wise. That is, one says\nto onese lf that one is wise enough not to be blinded by the\nbribe, but to no avail. The very bribe, argued Bacon, is what\nblinds one to the truth, as it is the flattery to oneself. It is only\nself-deception that stands between humanity and salvation\nthrough science. People flatter themselves that they are\ncleverer and more knowledgeable than they are, thus getting\nblind to criticism. Moreover, the psychology of perception as\nfirst offered by Bacon, and as still taught today, suggests that\nnothing can be done about it. To become a good researcher,\nsaid Bacon, one must humbly admit ignorance, and relinquish\nall the preconceived notions that one happens to have; only\nthen, he said, will one qualify to seek knowledge, and even\nthen this holds as long as one does not pro nounce opinions.\nBacon's idea is generally rejected nowadays. It is generally\nagreed that people cannot live with empty heads. (Only some\ndevotees of popular cheap versions of Oriental mysticism\nendorse the false view that some techniques empty the head of\nall ideas.)\nThe observation that theory blinds one to facts that offer\ncriticism of it is a central part of contemporary psychology of\nperception and cognition. It often goes today by the name of\nthe 20th -century psychologist Leon Festinger. This observ ation\nhas led some thinkers, such as Giordano Bruno and Galileo\nGalilei of the 16th and 17th century, to the obvious conclusion\nthat such observations spuriously validate the theories that\ninvoke them. Bacon agreed but claimed that a theory can be\nproperly validated -- when it is rooted in unbiased\nobservations: As long as theory precedes observation, he said,\nits validation by facts is assured for all those who propound it\nand for no other; only if it emerges by itself out of many and\ndiverse observations, he assured his reader, is the result truly\nassured and will convince all. Hence, proper observation begins\nwith the cleaning of the observer's mind, and therefore\nobservers must be humble and attend to small facts, not aspire\nto be the proud originators o f great philosophical systems.\nWhy is the sin of pride so special in the scheme of things? Why\nare all sins to be viewed as errors, yet pride the sin at the root\nof error? Bacon answered that pride too is but error; of course\nit is a form of self -deception. It is the error that is the source\nof all errors, as it inhibits the natural disposition to learn the\ntruth; it perverts the natural order of things by placing theory\nprior to observation, like building a house beginning from the\nroof.\nBacon stressed that the matter is subtle. There was no known\nreason to forbid the making of conjectures before he discovered\nthat conjecture perverts the mind so that it is essential to\nrelinquish all preconceived notions before one can contribute to\nthe advancement of learning. Because the natural disposition to\ndevelop science is stronger than the disposition to make\nconjectures, Antiquity had knowledge and no reason to advance\nany conjecture. Then conjectures were advanced, especially\nthose of Aristotle, and they were wicked. Once knowledge was\nperverted, it could not be restored without Bacon's new cure --\nhis prescription of cleaning the slate and proceeding with\ncaution. Naturally until then self -deception was the rule.\nAccordingly, Bacon called his philosophy &#34;The Great\nInstauration&#34;, meaning the return to the golden age of\nAntiquity.\nA Short History of Self- Deception\nSelf- deception, to repeat, is ubiquitous, as is the folk literature\nabout it. Also, folk literature presents self -deception as self-\nflattery. This is a point that Bacon's doctrine makes central.\nBacon's proposal of a remedy had an old component and a new\none. The old component is the following advice: Do not be\ngullible, trust no one but the facts and your own reason. The\nnew component is; Discard all earlier opinions and start afresh.\nThis is Baconian radicalism, and this is what characterizes\nmodern, classical rationalist philosophy. Its most specific\ncharacteristic is its being Crusonian, as Popper and Gellner\nhave called it (Popper, 1945, vol. 2, pp. 219-20, 215; Gellner,\n1995, p. 7; see also Agassi, 1981b, pp. 477-85, 488). As\nDescartes found out, after cleaning one's slate and before\ndeveloping one's own philosophy, one is utterly alone. In the\n19th century Descartes' philosophy and his venture, the\nBaconian venture of starting afresh, were not as popular as in\nearlier centuries. One of its opponents was Kierkegaard (1985,\nPreface), who nevertheless admired Descartes for having the\ncourage needed for this venture. As this venture was deemed\ncentral to modern, classical rationalism, understandably,\nrejecting it led many, Kierkegaard included, to reject\nrationalism itself.\nThe reason that self -deception is the single obstacle, and such\na formidable one at that, is simple. Almost any obstacles that\nmay lie on the way of a self- reliant individual may be handled\nin the best manner available. The only insurmountable obstacle\nto self -reliance is self -deception, since its victims are unaware\nof its very presence. Classical rationalists deemed the Baconian\nventure of cleaning the slate indispensable because it is easy to\ndeceive oneself: As long as one holds to any opinion, to any\nopinion whatsoever, one is too well disposed toward it. Hence,\nthose who rejected Bacon's radicalism were disposed to the\nview that self -deception is unavoidable. After Bacon had\ngranted prominence and significance to the disposition for self -\ndeception as the chief obstacle to the advancement of learning,\nand so to advancement in general, it became clear that the\ndisposition to be rational depends on the single condition that\nself-deception be avoided. The irrationalists then centered, as\nthey still do, on this question: Can this single condition ever be\nmet? Irrationalism is the correct denial of the possibility of\navoiding all self- deception and the erroneous conclusion that it\nis better to rely on tradition, the leadership or one's gut -\nfeelings than on oneself.\n(Bacon's radicalism is not new: It is cabalistic in origin. Why\ndid the performance of the cabalistic ritual fail to bring\nsalvation? Because there is a catch here: To be valid, the ritual\nshould be perform by a deserving individual, and that individual\nmust be humble. But it is hard to be humble when one brings\nsalvation to the world. Why do people end up in hell if they\nmay repent even at the gates of hell? Because the wicked are\nhaughty, and, at the gate of hell, they deceive themselves that\nthey are there not deservedly, but out of good will - - out of the\nwill to save its inmates.)\nThe advocacy of self-reliance look as if it were identical to the\nadvocacy of rationality, and either looks as if it were identical\nto the advocacy of the avoidance of self- deception. The\nopposite of self-reliance is the reliance on others, who are not\nreliable, since there is nothing to rely o n except one's own\nreason. Hence, the reliance on others is being deceived and all\ndeception is self -deception at heart. According to Bacon, the\ntransition from reliance on others to self -reliance takes effort,\ncourage, and much good will. This is particularly so because,\nwe remember, according to Bacon, self -reliance begins with the\ncleaning of one's slate -- with starting afresh. This, as\nKierkegaard stressed, is rather frightening. It also leaves too\nmany questions unanswered, such as, what should one do in\nmatters pertaining to one's means of livelihood and of one's\nreligion? These questions were hardly ever dealt with.\nDescartes reported that he would not embark on the project of\ncleaning his slate before he had answered them to his own\nsatisfaction. To day, almost all students of this matter agree\nthat these questions were hardly ever dealt with, and they can\nnever be satisfactorily answered.\nThis is a significant point. Children have faith in a Santa Claus\nof one sort or another, and in their having m others. Somehow\nthe faith in Santa Claus fades away, but having mothers is\nnever questioned. (Feminists have a point, then, when they say\nthere could never have been a female Descartes.) The demand\nthat one should doubt even the existence of one's body, then,\nis only understandable in the sense that the extant scientific\ntheories of bodies should be doubted. Indeed, the idealists who\ndenied the existence of matter did not question the\ncommonsense view of matter and of their own having emerged\nout of their mothers' wombs. They questioned the theory of\nmatter propounded by Descartes, by Newton, or by other\nphysicists. It is no accident that the Baconian program and its\nexecution by Descartes concerned the improvement of the\nnatural sciences and technologies, hardly the improvement of\nthe social sciences (or the moral sciences, to use the\nantiquated terminology), and even less so the social and\npolitical technologies. The application of the Baconian program\nto social and political studies came later, as an afterthought,\nand its application to political affairs was unexpected and\nbizarre.\nThe Baconian project -- his plan to develop science - - was a\ngreat success, as was his idea that technology will develop\nmagnificently on scientific foundations. His view was e choed by\nhis followers John Locke, David Hume, and, above all, Adam\nSmith (Hal\xe9vy, 1955, p. 433). During the French Revolution it\nwas echoed by Condorcet (1976; see also Schapiro, 1934). It\nwas the faith that scientific -technological progress will\ninevitably improve social matters without much ado. This\nBaconian aspiration -- to save humanity through the\nadvancement of science and technology -- failed totally,\nalthough not before it landed humanity in the modern world --\nindustrial, post-industrial, and developing -- for better or\nworse.\nThe first great fiasco of the Baconian program to save humanity\nthrough the advancement of science and technology was the\nFrench Revolution. The idea is not new that the revolution was\nthe daughter of the ideas of the Enlightenment movement,\nespecially its radicalism. This idea was advanced by the leading\nReactionary thinkers, Edmund Burke and Georg Wilhelm\nFriedrich Hegel (see Agassi, 1977, pp. 218 -20). They did not\nsay it out right, but their followers did: People want to b e\ndeceived. They want that because they cannot practice self -\nreliance. This Reactionary idea helped the tyrants of the\nmodern, developed world immensely, and caused untold harm.\nThe Reaction had much less of a vision and no program, yet\nbeing conservative it could always fall back on tradition. The\ncentral idea of the Reaction, then, was that people need\ntradition to tell them what to believe in. This takes the central\nidea of the Reaction out of the present discourse. The Reaction\nmade a concession to the Enlightenment movement: Some\nindividuals can be self -reliant. They prove it by going into the\ndesert and staying there without food, drink, or company for\nforty days and forty nights. The Reaction deprived even the few\nself- reliant individuals of their reason: They are exceptional\nbecause they are extremely ambitious, and they follow their\nown bent no matter what. This is a recommendation for self-\ndeception on a grand scale. It suggests that the exceptional\nmust be lonely and stubborn, which is what cha racterizes many\npsychopathological cases. Indeed, Hegel said there is no way to\ndistinguish between the exceptional who is a genius from the\none who is crazy, or alienated, to use the term of Pinel: To be\njudged alienated (by accepted norms) is the price for one's\ndecision to be self -reliant (until one manages to alter the\nnorms and then be declared a hero). The Reactionary doctrine\nof dependence and self - reliance is a gross exaggeration. Let us\nreturn to a more commonsensical version of rationalism\n(Agassi, 1981b, Chapter 15.)\nExtreme Rationalism as Self- Deception\nNo rule of logic is more potent than that which proscribes\ncontradictions: They are deadly. Not only are they\ndemonstrably false; declaring one true is the denial of all error,\nand so it is the admission of every possible statement.\nNevertheless, a mathematical text can all too easily include\none. In mathematics a misprint may introduce an error, and\nintroducing an error into a mathematical system usually\namounts to adding a contradiction to it (the equation 1 + 2 = 3\nbecomes a contradiction when any one item in it is misprinted).\nStrictly, the rule banning all contradictions renders all texts\nthat contain such misprints worthless. However, it is often easy\nto eliminate misprints by simply overlooking them, and this is\ndone heedlessly unless and until they cause trouble. Even\nresearchers whose ideas seem inconsistent are known to\nproceed working without worry about inconsistency, in the hope\nthat this matter will be taken care of later. It is hard to judge\nhow rational this attitude is; in the oversight of inconsistency,\none risks the waste of time in the study of a worthless system.\nIf the system under study happens to be consistent, or if the\ninconsistency in it is easy to remove, the result of the study\nmay be useful. However, often a researcher investing much\nefforts in some interesting question will obtain exciting results\nthat rest on an inconsistency, so that the invested labor was\nsheer waste.\nHere is an interesting corollary to the theory of self-deception.\nIt is one thing to take a calculated risk, regardless of whether\nthe end result is happy. It is quite another thing to pretend to\nhave taken a calculated risk, be optimistic about matters, and\nforge ahead carelessly. Often the investment o f effort is only of\nsome pleasant hours of research that one may easily afford to\nlose. It is an observed fact that if stakes are high and the\nresearcher is highly strung, self -deception steps in as the\nrefusal to entertain the merest possibility of an error. It is hard\nto differentiate the reasonable cases of calculated risk from the\ncases of carelessness, as there is no theory that tells us when\nthe risk is great and when not. Perhaps there can be no such\ntheory regarding research.\nSo much for the requirement for consistency. It is more\ndifficult to study other requirements, as these may be\nabandoned. This is the case with demonstrability - - the super-\ncriterion traditionally most generally adhered to and rightly\nmost respected. It is invalid; adherence to it causes confusion\nand self -deception. Without the assumption that philosophers\naddicted to it are deluding themselves, it is hard to explain its\npopularity, despite its great allure. Historically, it is a central\nidea, and yet today it is recognized as most baffling. What is\ndemonstrability? What theory of it is there? As its natural place\nis in mathematics, it can be examined there first.\nThe standard examples of demonstrations -- of proofs -- are\nmathematical, especially those of Euclid and of Archimedes. By\nmodern standards, the quality of these demonstrations is very\nlow. Russell (1917, pp. 66, 94-50) said that Euclid's proofs\nscarcely qualify. The first to have offered reasonable proofs,\nsaid Russell, was George Boole, at the mid -19th century (p.\n74). In classical geometry, proofs consisted of deductions from\nthe axioms of geometry. What follows from a theorem is a\ntheorem, yet two nagging questions remained unanswered.\nFirst, what makes the axioms theorems? Answer: Axioms are\nself-evident: it is impossible to question their truth. Yet at\nleast one axiom of Euclid was always questioned (for each\nstraight line no more than one parallel line goes through a\ngiven point). In the 19th century, a system of geometry was\nconstructed in which that axiom was relinquished. Early in the\n20th century, Einstein developed a theory of gravity whose\ngeometry is non-Euclidean. (It denies that space is the same\neverywhere, as it assumes that the properties of space differ\nwhere gravity differs.) So much for the self-ev idence of axioms.\nThe other question is, how is proof possible without axioms? It\nhas to do with the theorems in the fields of arithmetic and of\nalgebra. These were not based on axioms until early in the 20th\ncentury.\nSo much for proofs. As to proof theo ry, it was developed in the\n1930s by combined efforts of a few great logicians. Their work\nwas clouded by confusions, most of which were cleared decades\nlater. Perhaps even now, proof theory is too problematic, so\nthat perhaps we are still not entitled to claim possession of a\nclear proof theory, not even in logic and mathematics.\nYet the puzzling fact is that classical rationalist philosophy\nrested on the idea that rationality equals proof. An example of\nthe magnitude of the puzzlement may be useful, especially as it\nprovides the flavor of the feeling that accompanies the\nsituation. The classical and most popular work of Wittgenstein\n(1922, Preface and famous last sentence) is accompanied by an\nair of tremendous tension: It declares that, on the one hand,\nwhat it says is so obvious that its articulation is neither\npossible nor called for, and on the other hand it is so difficult\nthat it is beyond words. Much controversy rages as to how to\nread his text, and much of it revolves around the question of\nproof and provability, and of what exactly the message about it\nis. Possibly, however, the literature in question is a mere\nexpression of a tremendous sense of frustration at the inability\nof commentators to face their own inability to prove, which is\nto say tha t the literature in question is a mere exercise in the\nfutility of self-deception.\nAs proof theory developed, it was proved that all effective\nproof procedures are limited, even in mathematics, let alone\nelsewhere, were proof elsewhere at all possible. T he proof --\nG\xf6del's celebrated proof -- was rejected by Wittgenstein. In the\nmeantime, the matter has developed much further, and proof\nprocedures and their limitations have become a field of\nintensive study within computer science. What is not provable\nin one system may be provable in another, as it can be added\nas an axiom; but their addition will create other unprovable\ntheorems. Contrary to Wittgenstein, there is no comprehensive\nsystem in which the logical status of all that can be said is\ndecided once and for all.\nThe idea that rationality equals proof is most basic. It is the\nsource of much strength, but also of much self-deception --\nwithin philosophy as well as within science. Bacon,\nWittgenstein, and many others said, when in doubt one should\nrefrain from endorsing any opinion, one should suspend\njudgment, and one should never express any opinion about\nwhat is doubtful, particularly not in public. Otherwise, self-\ndeception is inevitable. This idea, hostile to self-deception as it\nis, looks immune to it. The fear that it is itself the malady it\ncomes to cure is as frightening as the idea that physicians\ncause death. The fear that the medicine is worse than the ills it\ncomes to cure produces a feeling of helplessness, and that\nfeeling is a tremendous incentive for self -deception. Indeed,\nthis is what happened when Semmelweis brought crucial\nempirical evidence to support the claim that physicians kill\npatients by not washing their hands. For decades his view and\nhis prescription were rejected by his peers. This is a clear case\nof a dangerous, irresponsible, grand -scale self-deception,\npracticed by a scientifically oriented group.\nHowever erroneous classical rationalism is, it is still very\npopular among philosophers who like it for its advocacy of the\nuse of reason and its support of science and of self -reliance.\nYet it is itself a case of self-deception. These days, the rule of\nscience is tacitly identified as the acceptance of the expert's\nauthority. This is very disconcerting, as any acceptance of any\nauthority is, as it conflicts with the demand for self- reliance. It\nis also silly. It is well known that the acceptance of the expert's\nauthority may be fatal (see last paragraph for an example). The\nstandard answer to this trite observation is that the reliance on\nexperts is unavoidable in the modern world. Even it were\nunavoidable, this does not make it less fatal. Moreover, the\nunavoidability of the reliance on experts has nothing particular\nto do with the modern world: It has always been the case, an d\nit is much less so today, when the educated citizen knows more\nmedicine than the best physician of a century ago. As the\nhypothesis that there is no choice but to rely on experts is\nrefuted, it may be replaced with increasingly better hypotheses\nthat wil l say how far and under which conditions the reliance on\nthe experts' authority is worse than doing altogether without\nthem. The reliance on experts' authority is clearly the worst\nsuperstition of the allegedly rationalist and the allegedly\nscientifically inclined, and this includes most research scientists\naround (Feyerabend, 1970).\nSelf- Deception as Fixation\nBacon's doctrine of prejudice was limited to the prejudices of\nthe researchers. Marx extended it to the views -- the prejudices\n-- extant in the gene ral population, especially the extant\nphilosophy of life. He labeled it 'ideology'. Following Hegel he\ndenied the universalism of the Enlightenment movement, and\nreplaced it with the view that the parochial views are locally\nvalid. (Hegel called the views and attitudes agreeable to the\nstate 'the Universal'.) This theory is known as relativism or,\nmore specifically, epistemic and moral relativism (see Agassi,\n1992). Every period of history, Hegel said, has its own truths,\nas created by the heroes who are the leading lights of that\nperiod. These heroes together constitute the group of\nindividuals who count -- &#34;the World Historical Figures.&#34; Marx\naccepted Hegel's epistemic and moral relativism only for the\npast -- for class society. He declared the truth in a class\nsociety to be socially determined, but he taught that, in\nclassless society, the truly universal would prevail. Hence, in a\nclass society all truths are relative and socially determined.\nHence, all ideology is class prejudice. Being prejudices,\nideologies are hard to shake off. This can only be done by\nindividuals who can peer into the mechanisms of history, like\nMarx himself -- they can divine the future society and the\ntruths of that society.\nAccording to Marx the society of his day was ruled by\nemployers, by the capitalists. He predicted that the ruling class\nof his day were destined to be replaced by employees, by the\nworkers. He viewed other philosophers as captives of capitalist\nprejudices. He viewed himself as the mouthpiece of the future\nsociety. He viewed the prejudices of the capitalists inferior to\nthose of the workers. He therefore held the view that the views\nhe was holding were superior to those held by other\nphilosophers.\nThis is Hegelian: The top representative of humanity, be it the\ntop nation (Hegel), top class (Marx), top civilization or culture\n(Spengler, Toynbee), or anything else that is tops, is tops in\neach and every respect. Hegel had a simple justification for this\nbizarre idea: The best is the militarily strongest, and the\nstrongest takes all that is of value -- the way Napoleon robbed\nthe countries he conquered of their artwork. Hegel and Marx\nnever explained why the arts and sciences always progress and\nthey disregarded the historical facts of regress. The most\nconspicuous fact that Greek art and science are superior to\nmediaeval art and science was brushed aside with the aid of\nthe claim for the superiority of the mediaeval political system\nor its agricultural technology over its predecessors. This is only\nevidence that being superior in one dimension is no guarantee\nfor superiority in another. This option did not occur to Marx nor\nto Marxist scholars in the middle of the 20th century. (The\nfamous scientist and historian of science J. D. Bernal (1939,\nChapter 2, Section 1) declared flippantly that medieval science\nis superior to Greek science. (See also Bernal, 1952, 1954, p.\n209; Agassi, 1963, Chapter 7 and notes.)\nTraditionally, philosophy was reductionist: It recommended that\nevents that belong to the different human sc iences should be\nexplained by theories from only one human science. Traditional\nreduction was to psychology: All human science, it was\nsuggested, are at heart psychology: Sociology, politics and\neconomics are really parts of psychology. Bacon's doctrine of\nprejudice was perhaps behind this trend. When Hegel reduced\nthe individual to society and declared political history the basic\nhuman science, he declared it essential for sanity to believe in\nnational myths. Marx advocated the reduction of all human\nsciences to economics. He wanted to see all explanation of\nhuman affairs by reference to the economic conditions of the\nsociety in which they occur, chiefly in terms of the\nadvancement of its technology. Freud, however, clung to the\ntraditional recommendation to reduce all human phenomena to\npsychology. He attempted to explain the way some private\nprejudices have a strong hold on the minds of their victims: He\nwas impressed by the fact that neuroses constitute intellectual\nblind spots, especially when the neurotics who sustain them are\nintelligent. He explained this by his theory of the emotional\ntrauma ('trauma' means wound).\nFreud's theory of the emotional trauma is simple. The cause of\nevery neurosis, he suggested, is a trauma caused by some\nfrightening, painful childhood event. Initially, the trauma leads\nto an attempt to cope with it by conjecturing a hypothesis.\nBeing infantile, this hypothesis is not surprisingly of a low\nintellectual level. What is surprising is that the neurotic never\ngets over the init ial hypothesis. This, Freud explained, is due to\ntwo facts. First, reliving the traumatic incident is painful.\nSecond, one attempts to avoid that pain. For example, if one\nconjectures that the pain in question is caused by the rejection\ndue to one's lack o f achievement, one will increase one's\nefforts to achieve. The refutation of the hypothesis will only\nlead to redoubling the effort, rather than to recognizing that no\neffort will reverse the rejection (because one tries to achieve\nthe wrong object, becaus e the rejection is irreversible, because\nthere was no rejection to begin with, or because of anything\nelse). Therefore, the purpose of psychoanalytic treatment\nshould be liberating neurotics from the prejudices that are at\nthe base of their neurotic conduct, which incapacitates them.\nThis, according to Freud, can be achieved only by helping them\nrelive their initial traumatic experiences. Once this is achieved,\npatients experience strong relief and a sense of catharsis, and\nthen, according to Freud, all is well.\nThis is Freud's celebrated catharsis theory. He later claimed to\nhave refuted it to his own satisfaction. It is difficult to say what\nreplaced catharsis as the aim of psychoanalytic treatment after\nthat theory was abandoned. Possibly Freud was too hasty to\nreject the theory; Possibly the fault was not in the ascription of\ntherapeutic power to catharsis, but in the view that, after it,\nthe patient is well and the treatment is over. I (Agassi, 1981a)\nhave suggested that the recovered mental patient ne eds\ntreatment that is usually accorded to the physically\nconvalescent. When a convalescent has weak muscles, it\nmatters little why; the question is, how should they be\nstrengthened? The same may be true of the mentally\nconvalescent, whose decision power is small. If so, what\nprecisely the prejudice was that the catharsis reveals is less\nimportant than the treatment accorded to willing mentally\nconvalescents. This shows that Freud's theory is one of self -\ndeception. It is a model for a number of such theories , yet not\na sufficiently good one, as it does not take into account the\natrophy of self -reliance due to prolonged neurosis. Freud has\nrightly observed that adolescents often get rid of their\nprejudices, but not those acquired under severe traumas --\ninclud ing morality, which is thus inculcated under the\nconditions of brainwashing, said Feyerabend (1968).\nSelf- deception can be treated in all generality. It is rational to\ninquire, to seek the truth, but perhaps not at any cost. At\ntimes, the search for the truth is too costly, and its outcome is\nof little significance. In these cases, it is reasonable to give up\nthe quest. This is a troublesome catch. One remains ignorant,\nfirst, of the truth that one allows to remain hidden, and then\nalso of the cost of giv ing it up - - of relinquishing it. More than\nBacon, Freud renders self -deception as the opposite of the\nsearch for the truth. He insisted more on the relentless search\nfor the truth. Yet the limitation on the cost of the search for\nthe truth remains. Select iveness is unavoidable, and one about\nthe search for the truth is inherently blind. What should be\ndone about this? Freud was troubled by interminable analysis,\nwhich is an expression of both the excessive cost of analysis\nand its contribution to the increased atrophy of the patient's\nself- reliance.\nThis is where Freud got stuck. Bacon's doctrine relates to the\nsearch for the scientific truth. He said the search should not be\nselective, because any selection is guided by an idea, and that\nidea is a prejud ice: It is judgment prior to the presentation of\nthe relevant evidence. Even asking specific question, Bacon\nsaid, is selective. The choice of a question is rooted in a\nprejudice. To avoid prejudice, research must be indiscriminate\nand all discovery accide ntal. Freud's view of his own research\nwas orthodox Baconian; his claim that his theory evolved out of\nmyriads of observations was clearly Baconian; his suggestion\nthat analysts intervene minimally in the analytic process of\nself-discovery was based on his fear of prejudice. Yet his\ntheory was related to everyday life, where the question about\nthe search for the truth cannot be as all encompassing as in\nresearch. Thus, he could not say how neuroses-free the\naverage citizen should be (Freud, 1962, third para graph from\nthe end).\nFreud appealed to simple common sense: One often deviates\nfrom the normal healthy views of things, and one is then\nnormally corrected by circumstances or by peers. It is abnormal\nto resist this kind of correction. Abnormal resistance to\ncommon sense is at times intelligent, as in the case of a\nresearch scientist. Alternatively, it is sometimes unintelligent,\nat other times it is hardly a trouble, and still other times it\nincapacitates. This then requires treatment. Here then is the\nplace for Freud's original contribution: The neurotic resistance\nis still rational, although it is obsessive (i.e., pathological). It\nis the insistence of avoiding the pain of reliving the trauma.\nThis is a hurdle the incapacitated should be helped to clear.\nReluctance to discuss one's opinions rationally is the outcome\nof the assessment that discussion will be painful. However, one\nis never able to assess properly the cost of the reluctance to\nacquire information for want of that very information. Therefore\none should always be ready to reassess one's view that the\npain is not worth the benefit. If common sense calls for this\nreassessment and is met with an obsessive refusal, perhaps the\ncause is psychopathological. Otherwise, the resistance is better\ndiagnosed differently, especially when it expresses the fear of\nself- reliance ('decidophobia' is the apt term offered by\nKaufmann, 1973).\nConclusion: The New Theory of Rationality\nThe discussion thus far is couched within common sense or in a\nframework that diffe rs radically from the classical theory of\nrationality. Since Freud fully endorsed that theory, his\ndiscussion was possibly inconsistent -- in that it mixed common\nsense with the classical theory of rationality. Even if it is\nconsistent, it is encumbered with irrelevant difficulties, and in\nits original wording it is much harder to comprehend than its\n(more general) variant reproduced here.\nThe discussion herein also deviates from the classical theory of\nrationality in its avoidance of the theory that the rational is the\nprovable. Nor does it require an explicit wording of an\nalternative theory of rationality. The new theory of rationality\nthat is required should share with common sense the idea that\nthere is no human perfection. It should not assume any pa rt or\naspect of any product of the human mind to be perfect and\nabove error. Briefly, it should include the idea that it is\ndesirable to eliminate error as far as possible; it suggests that\nthis is done by criticism. Criticism, then, should be viewed not\nas hostile, but as help. This idea is not new, and is clearly\nexpressed in Plato's Gorgias. Yet in the writings of Plato (and\nAristotle) the rationality of criticism is presented as a mere\npreliminary to the rationality of proof. Omitting this, we receive\nthe new theory of rationality, or a variant of it: Critical\ndiscussion is not the appetizer but the main course. Hence, it is\nnot just concerning received opinions, as Plato and Aristotle\nsuggested, but an endless process of inventing ever newer\nconjectures and their refutations -- as much as is within the\npowers of the participants in the process Popper, 1945,\n[Agassi, 1995). (This raises the question, is logic perfect, and\nis mathematics? These matters are not discussed here,\nalthough they are of great philosophical interest.)\nThe assumption that criticism is rational is very rational, and\nits rejection by Bacon and his followers is a great pity,\nalthough Bacon was right to observe that critical discussion as\npracticed in the universities was an exercise in futility. The first\nmodern variant of the fallibilist theory of rationality, which\nincorporates the assumption that rationality is critical debate,\nis due to Popper (1945, Chapter 24). His theory is not free of\nobjections, especially Bacon's. Criticism may be pointless at\ntimes. It can also be an unaffordable luxury. It is impossible to\nknow if this applies to the case at hand. The theory under\nconsideration may deserve criticism and it may not: Investing\nin criticism risks wasting valuable time.\nExamp les of irrational critical thinking abound, and at times\nthey can be classified as pathological. Psychotherapists are\nfamiliar with many kinds of them. Patients are often ingenious\nat inventing new excuses that allow them to ignore or belittle\ncriticism of their views and conduct. Patients are likewise\ningenious at inventing criticisms of, and in finding lacunae in,\nthe assumptions behind threatening proposals of therapists.\nPeople often use many tools -- physical or mental -- without\nbothering about their inner mechanisms. When patients are\nafraid of using a proposal made by their therapists, they\nsuddenly show passionate interest in the mechanisms involved\nin the proposal and in critical debates about them. These\npassionate interests are delay tactics and expressions of fear.\nThe observation of Konrad Lorenz is relevant here: Conduct\nunder fear and pressure is less intelligent than the average in\nall animals. The claim made here is that even losing one's mind\nis a process due to rational conduct, but in fea r and under\ngreat stress, and so with an ever-decreasing level of rationality\n(Fried &amp; Agassi, 1976).\nThus, there are levels of rationality; the highest level available\nis hardly ever attained. It is approached only in some very\nleisurely, research -oriented discussions. Even then it is not\nalways clear what avenue is best to take (contrary to classical\nrationalism), as there are many possibilities, some of them\ninherently blind. Thus, it is only seldom clear how the level of\nrationality can be raised. Tha t the rationality of action may be\na matter of degree is common sense, and if all rationality\nshould be seen as a matter of degree, it is useful to view\nrational thought as a variant of rational action. Traditionally,\nrational thought, or rational opinion, was distinguished from\nrational action (including thinking). This is reinforced by the\ntraditional distinction between states (of mind) and (mental)\nprocesses. This distinction is subtle and redundant: Jarvie and I\n(Agassi &amp; Jarvie, 1987) have suggested to v iew thought as a\nkind of action and the theory of rational thought as a part of\nthe theory of rational action. This is meat to be a supplement\nto Popper's theory of rationality.\nThere are two points to mention before bringing this chapter to\na close. First, unlike the classical theory of rationality, the\nfallibilist theory does not split rationality sharply to the\nscientific and the rest. It also recognizes common sense and its\nprogress. (Think of the views of nutrition common a century\nago, which reco mmended what is today viewed as empty\ncalories and/or a cholesterol-rich diet; or of sexuality, which\ndeemed masturbation self-destructive and the pleasure of sex\nundesired by decent women.) It also takes for granted that, in\nscience as elsewhere, every significant criticism is an\ninvention, so that it is important to see the difficulty of being\ncritical (and so of being highly rational). This relates to the\nsecond point. The fear of criticism is rational, but not as\nrational as the effort to overcome it. Self-deception is thus a\nform of rational human conduct, but it is inferior to attempts to\novercome fear and more so to fearless openness. This is not to\nsay that every possible case of self -deception is equally\nharmful and to be equally harshly combated. O ften\npsychotherapists encounter cases that they judge -- hopefully\nrightly - - as not deserving treatment. The cases that do\ndeserve treatment, even at a great cost, Freud noted, are those\nthat grossly interfere with the ordinary course of life. Some\ncases are subtle and difficult to judge. A sense of proportion\nmust prevail in discussing them. The pursuit of the truth is\nlaudable, but it is not necessarily always the required\ntreatment.\nA sense of proportion is indispensable anyway, since there is no\ngreater self -deception than the claim that one is utterly free of\nit, as is regrettably exemplified by the great thinkers Bacon,\nMarx, and Freud. This should be remembered as a warning\nagainst excessive self -confidence: Humans are all fallible and,\nas Plato already observed in great detail, it behooves us to be\ngrateful for any attempt at criticism and correction.\nAppendix\nThe editor has drawn my attention to a very recent essay by\nAlfred R. Mele (Mele, 1996), that deserves notice because it\ncomprises a very comprehensive survey of the most recent\nliterature on self-deception, which is becoming increasingly\nfashionable these days. The literature is written from the\nviewpoint of the theory of rationality as the rational degree of\nbelief and that as the degree to which the belief is justified by\nexperience. This viewpoint was declared in this chapter as a\nversion of self-deception, perhaps also an expression of some\nanxiety. The starting -pint of that literature is the so-called\nparadox of self -deception. Assume that successful deception\noccurs when one who thinks that some statement is true\nconvinces someone else that it is not. Assume further that one\nsuccessfully deceives oneself the same way. As a result, one\ndoes and does not think that the statement in question is true.\nAs was explained here, it is easier to begin with self -deception\nand view most cases of deception as variants of it. As explained\nin this chapter, self-deception is always a form of ambiguity\nand/or confusion and ignorance, so that it is a spectrum, and\nthere is no sharp division between those engaged in it and\nthose who keep clear of it, although some people are very near\nthe one end of the spectrum and others on the other.\nMele reports numerous experiments in self -deception, with no\nregard to th e question, how well trained the subjects of the\nexperiment are in the art of self -criticism. The absence of self-\ncriticism, it was argued in this chapter, is not the same as self-\ndeception, especially since all criticism is the result of some\ncreative act . There is also the question of the cost of self -\ncriticism that the experiments discussed by Mele disregard. The\nexperimenters do not ask, how important is the self-deception\nunder discussion and how important the individuals in question\nconsiders it. Most engagement in astrology by modern educated\npeople is a mild, harmless form of self -deception that cannot\nbe taken as seriously as the case of self -deception that leads to\ndisaster.\nReferences\nAgassi, J.

 u"Giuseppe Franco, editor, Der Kritische Rationalismus als Denkmethode und\nLebensweise: Festscrhift zum 90. Geburtstag von Hans Albert. Klagenfurt: Kitab,\n2012, 34-55\nCritical Rationalism, Comprehensive or Qualified:\nThe Popper-Bartley Dispute\nBy Joseph Agassi,\nTel-Aviv University and York University, Toronto\n0. Background.\nKarl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945,\nCh. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason.\nLater on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and\neven called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to\nhis annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave,\n1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter\nis very complicated. Let me show this now.\nFideism is a minimal retreat from classical rationalism. As this theory is\ncomprehensive in its demand for proof as ultimate justification, it begs the question\nof its own justification. All parties to the current dispute admit that this is a defect\nthat has no cure except by some modification. To that end adherents to fideism\nadvocate some axiom taken on faith as the minimum necessary concession to\nirrationalism. The rationalism that the advocates of fideism qualify is the classical\ntheory of rationality, that is, to be precise, an assertion plus a demand. The theory is,\nrationality equals proof. The demand is to make an assertion \u2013 or to endorse it, to\nbelieve it \u2013 if and only if proof is available that the assertion is true. As the skeptics\nhave shown, any proof of any (synthetic) assertion requires a proof theory that\nrequires proof in its turn. (The possibly of proof in logic and in mathematics has no\nplace in the present discussion.) The skeptics have then recommended holding no\nbelief, making no definite assertion, holding all views only tentatively. Skeptics\nclaim that they have a proof that no proof is possible that should satisfy classical\nrationalists. Most rationalists have invested much effort in attempts to find fault in\nthat proof, and they are still trying. As this essay concerns the dispute between\nPopper and Bartley, who both endorse the skeptic proof, we may take the skeptical\nproof for granted. Hence, the classical theory of rationality cannot stay as it is. The\nadvocates of fideism conclude, then, that some retreat is imperative. The minimal\ndeviation is an assertion that advocates of fideism recommend to endorse without\nproof. That is to say, they recommend its endorsement upon faith. There are two\nstandard candidates for that assertion: the principle of induction and the faith of one\u2019s\nforefathers.\nOf course, not all deviation from the classical theory of rationality is fideist.\nSince advocates of fideism propose that the deviation from the old view should be\nminimal, it is hard to see how this proposal is contestable. An obvious point to\ncontest concerns the question, what deviation is minimal. On this Popper has made a\nbrilliant alternative proposal. Although it has not gained popularity among advocates\nof fideism, it is obviously the best thus far offered. It is this. The least concession\nshould not be the faith in any principle of induction, much less in a given traditional\nfaith, but preferably in the possibility that rational debate may generate progress.\nAdvocates of fideism may object to this obviously superior proposal: it accompanies\na lower standard of rationality. Whereas the classical theory of rationality equates\nrationality with proof, Popper\u2019s theory equates rationality with the critical attitude.\nWhat is preferable, one irrational axiom or this reduction of the standard? The\nanswer is that the reduction of the standard is necessary anyway since the skeptical\ncriticism of traditional rationalism is valid. (Thus, Bertrand Russell advocated the\nadoption of some principle of induction upon faith in the hope that it will suffice to\njustify current science [Russell, 1992, 38]; [Russell, 1996, 313-28]. He did not\nmanage to formulate it explicitly.)\nPopper has proposed two brilliant minimizing moves: of the standard of\nrationality and of the concession to irrationalism. Bartley has shown that there is no\nneed for the two moves, as one will do. This he proved conclusively: reducing the\nstandard of rationality renders a concession unnecessary. It is a shame that Popper\nhas not admitted this, suggesting instead that Bartley just improved the wording of\nwhat he had intended to advocate all along: he denied that he made the mistake that\nBartley had attributed to him. It is likewise a shame that Bartley conflated his valid\ncriticism of Popper with his own alternative to it: only the criticism, not the\nalternative to the criticized theory, is uncontestable. The errors on both sides led to an\nimpasse. In desperation, Bartley called Popper a fideist, and Popper took offence. My\naim here is to rectify these two errors and thus restore the peace between their ghosts.\nNow the fideism that Bartley has saddled Popper with is at the very least not\nthe traditional version but an improvement on it. It says, welcome critical scrutiny as\nprogressive. If this is a version of fideism, then it is an admirable version of it. Both\nPopper and Bartley have confused this idea, be it a version of fideism or not, with a\nslightly greater demand: do not advocate a theory unless it has passed critical\nscrutiny. This version of rationalism, be it fideist or not, both Popper and Bartley\nrejected, and rightly so, despite its superiority over the more traditional versions of\nfideism. Regrettably they did not praise it before rejecting it, although by the canons\nof criticism they should have.\nTaking for granted here the skeptical criticism of traditional rationalism, let us\nconsider the question, which modification of it is right? Considering any proposed\nmodification, why should we adopt it? To take it upon faith has all the defects of\nfideism without its advantage (of being a minimal concession). For the sake of the\nargument, let us agree to prefer the modification that is the smallest concession to\nirrationalism. What is it? And is that preferable to the original fideist view? And\nworse, how are we to adjudicate on this without begging the question? Still worse,\nwhatever answer to this question that we may offer, will it not remain fideist at heart?\nBartley acutely observed that when Popper said that his proposal (to takes the\nfaith in reason on faith) is a deviation from rationalism, he was in error (or at the very\nleast unclear): the deviation is from classical, not from critical rationalism: applied to\nitself, classical rationalism does not live by its own precepts (it begs the question);\napplied to itself, critical rationalism may live by its own precepts, at least possibly so.\nSo far this criticism of Bartley is obviously right, and Popper should have\nacknowledged its validity. Unfortunately this did not happen. Partly it was Popper\u2019s\nfailing, partly it was a confusion that rested on the fact that Bartley had his own view\nof critical rationalism that Popper had all the right to reject \u2013 but not before admitting\nthe validity of Bartley\u2019s criticism.\nFor my own part, I am no party to this dispute [Agassi, 1981, 72, 100, 465-71,\n474, 476]. My aim here is not to take sides but to clarify it and perhaps to remove the\nvery ground for it. I reject the framework within which it takes place. My alternative\nto that framework is the idea that rationalism is a working hypothesis. Thus it is\nneither a basis for rational thought nor an object of faith, but simply an assumption\nthat facilitate rational deliberations. It seems to me that on second thought both\nPopper and Bartley would have agreed. They could object that I have not said what\nrational deliberation is, but here I defer to their own views on it, which are quite\ntraditional and also sufficiently unproblematic to serve as the default option.\nMy effort to neutralize a dispute may sound like an exercise in the tradition of\nlogical positivism. It is not. For, it replaces a metaphysical framework with a better\none, and it does not destroy a problem but replaces it with a better alternative, much\nin the tradition of critical rationalism. Thus, needless to say, I ascribe my alternative\nto Popper and Bartley and take their input as either propaedeutic (preparatory) or the\nlong way around, as you like it.\n1. The hyper-stable working hypothesis\nWhat characterizes a working hypothesis most is its fluidity: there is no commitment\nand hardly any reason to it: its adoption is for a lark. One may even take it on a whim,\nthough on occasion it is common sense. And what one takes on a whim is ephemeral,\nof course. Still, some working hypotheses stay, for good reasons or bad. My concern\nis with a working hypothesis that is hyper-stable. So let me show first that these exist.\nMy claim is that this stability is the most general characteristic of any reasonable\nview of duty. So please be patient.\nWe act voluntarily yet under constraints. Classical liberal thinkers often said,\nin principle there is no difference between free and coerced action. Nevertheless, one\ndifference matters, between keenness and reluctance: we may act reluctantly out of a\nsense of duty. Of course, classical liberal thinkers viewed duty-bound conduct as not\npeculiar, as it is up to us to decide to behave morally, so that we always act\nvoluntarily. Nevertheless, the difference between the fulfillment of one\u2019s own\ninterest and that of others is a matter of principle. This is particularly so in cases of\nacts with unlikely consequences. When we face options that are not likely to yield\nfruits, we tend to adopt choices that are easiest: the game is not worth the candle, we\nmay say to ourselves and quit. Yet when the game is obligatory, this is unacceptable.\nMany moral acts are unlikely to have worthy consequences, yet were that a sufficient\nexcuse for quitting a task allows us to be socially apathetic and even asocial. When it\ncomes to affairs of other people and more so to public affairs, as the duty of hope we\nshould grant the Good Lord the benefit of doubt [Agassi, 1999, 50-4, 124-5]. In our\nown affairs we may be more realistic. Hence, whereas optimism as an opinion is\nfoolish, as an attitude it is just right and often even obligatory.\nThis is a peculiarity of action out of duty as opposed to one out of self-interest,\nand so classical liberal theory is wanting. Its error rested, indeed, on an optimist\nassessment of the outcome of the broad application of rationality: optimist\nassessments prevent the appearance of the difference in attitude that morality\nprescribes between satisfying the personal interests and those of others . World War II\nexposed this optimism as an error. It matters not whether the error was in the\nassessment of the ease with which rationality would be broadly applicable or in the\nassessment of its outcome. What matters is that the optimist assessment of the\noutcome of our actions is no longer the default option, and that it should stay\nnonetheless as an assumption for our actions \u2013 as a stable working hypothesis.\nA dreadful example for this is the conduct of the Jewish leadership, especially\nthe Zionist leadership in the United States of America during the Holocaust. They\nsabotaged efforts to rescue the Jews of Europe [Agassi, 1999, Ch. 15]. Now they say,\nthey knew these efforts were hopeless. This is a mere excuse, not only because\nrecords available now refute this assessment, but also and more so because a priori\nsuch assessments may be false. Still, admittedly, at the time the assessment was bleak\nand it was reasonable (though erroneous). This example may be poor. This is of little\nconsequence, since alternative examples are easily available.\nThe hypothesis that we may make a difference should serve as a hyper-stable\nworking hypothesis. It is my alternative to the ideas of Popper and of Bartley about\nthe choice of a theory of rationality. Let me explain.\n2. Between Classical Rationalism and Fideism\nThe starting point here, to repeat, is the admission of the skeptical criticism of the\nclassical theory of rationality: proof is impossible. Advocates of irrationalis m often\nuse this criticism as the rationale for their rejection of all theories of rationality and\nof all proposal and demand to behave rationally. Those who reject the classical\ntheory but wish to adopt another add some adjective to the name of the theory of\nrationality to differentiate it from a theory that they might endorse. The adjectives\noften used are &#34;traditional&#34;, &#34;classical&#34; and &#34;Cartesian&#34;; Karl Popper suggested\n&#34;comprehensive&#34;, since the classical version advocates the comprehensive demand to\naffirm no view ever except proven ones.\nBeing comprehensive, classical rationalism demands to jettison all of familiar\nideas, so that the learning venture should begin afresh with no assumptions, with a\nclean slate, and with utterly open minds. In brief, classical rationalism is radical.\nDescartes attempted to apply it in his celebrated thought experiment, performed in\nthe hope that starting afresh guarantees the establishment of a true, scientific image\nof the world. He failed, as did all of his disciples.\nThe classical theory of rationality bumps into two interlocking standard\nobjections. The first is the classical skeptical argument: proof is question-begging.\nAn obvious logical way to overcome this is by the admission of some sufficiently\nstrong initial basic axiom. The standard examples are, the principle of the simplicity\nof nature, or of limited variety, or of induction. Some other axioms are available as\nwell. Their adherents defend their choices with a new argument that exposes the\ncomprehensiveness of classical rationalism as further weakness: the principle,\nwhatever it is, requires the assumption that it suffices for the development of a\nrational worldview and of science as we know it. This added assumption repeatedly\nmeets with a refutation that exposes the proposed principle as not good enough.\nConsider then the opposite extreme: irrationalism. Its advocates recommend\ngiving up rationality; this fascinates those who find the irrational attractive, appealing,\noverpowering: they are tired of rationality. They are intentionally unreasonable,\nforgetting that the intellect is the most powerful instrument that Nature has put at the\ndisposal of humanity, and the refusal to use it is lamentable. The advantage of\nunreason, however, is that it is license for the use of poor arguments. Those who use\nthis license denounce logic as perverse, as opposed to human natural healthy instincts,\nor to tradition or to traditional religion, or to whatever else they may advance as\nsuperior to reason. Yet, as a mere working hypothesis, this reveals some interesting\nideas. Prominent among these is the view of the first irrationalist, Heraclitus, the\nfamous pre-Socratic thinker, who probably reacted to the first version of rationalism,\nthat of Parmenides. Plato's Socrates called irrationalists mysologists, the haters of\nlogic (Phaido). Despite this hatred Heraclitus offered some valuable criticism of\nrationalism and some new ideas. Nevertheless, here let us dismiss misology.\nIrrationalists need not giving up the use of the intellect. Its use does not require\nany recognition of it as an authority over all thought processes \u2013 it can be useful\nwithout being authoritative in any way. Hence, irrationalists may have a choice in\nspecifying what portion of their thought process the intellect is not to control, as long\nas the choice does not intervene with their ability to use logic, even with a vengeance,\nin areas deemed well within the province of reason, such as mathematics and physics\nand their practical applications. What then is the suggestion to limit rationality?\nWhere exactly does rationality cease to adjudicate? The irrationalist literature has\nmany answers to this question that serve well as merely working hypotheses.\nThe better of the disenchanted with classical rationalism distinguish between\nthe criticism of the classical theory of rationality that all of them endorse and the idea\non which they disagree as to what to place outside the domain of the intellect. They\nrightly insist that the latter is less important than the former, since it leads them to\nagree that some presupposition, no matter what, must obtain with no rational basis,\nno matter upon what other kind of basis it might rest; indeed, they may add, one may\nendorse quite arbitrarily any presupposition as the initial basic axiom for rationality.\nSome presuppositions are so useless that they are overlooked. (For example, the\nassertion that Superman exists will be obviously utterly useless here.) They\nadvocated arbitrary presuppositions are usually far from being satisfactory too, but as\nworking hypotheses they may be handy and when one fails its advocate may abandon\nit for another. Of course, being irrationalists they may also cling to it dogmatically.\nAn example of this dogmatism is collectivism, made popular by \xc9mile\nDurkheim, one of the two acknowledged fathers of modern sociology. Most\nirrationalists endorse collectivism dogmatically, despite its obvious defects; they take\nas their initial basic axiom tradition, religious or national, or some authority,\nintellectual or political, or any other item that they declare vital for the maintenance\nof social stability. Their basic axiom then is that society with no stability is too\nobjectionable to take seriously into consideration as a viable option. This is sad, but\nthere are sad options on the opposite side too, namely on the side of individualism.\nAs a stable working hypothesis this is very common in the social sciences. It is\nespecially popular as Max Weber, the other of the two acknowledged fathers of\nmodern sociology. He took as the initial basic axiom for rationality a personal faith.\nThis is the source of the label \u201cfideism\u201d (&#34;fideo&#34; means, I believe). Advocates of\nfideism stress the logical impossibility of rationalism as long as it is comprehensive,\nand the need to choose an initial basic axiom in order to reinstate it. Assuming\nnothing, one has no reason to activate the project of developing rationalism and a\nrational worldview. This is the so-called &#34;the tu-quoque argument&#34; (meaning, you\ntoo): comprehensive rationalism is impossible, therefore, rationalism too rests on an\ninitial basic axiom, namely, that rationality is at all possible and desirable.\nRather than ask, what did Weber use for proof, let us examine the tu-quoque\nargument. Supposing that it is valid; does this support fideism? Does it exonerate the\nutter arbitrariness (absence of logic) of the choice of an initial basic axiom? It does\nnot sound right. Most advocates of fideism believe in their tradition and Weber hated\ntradition and expressed faith in science. This observation is so obvious that we must\nascribe its neglect to its being taken for granted: of course, the initial basic axiom has\nto be sufficiently rich in content to enable it to save rationalism from its initial\npredicament. That we take this constraint for granted is obvious, yet the systematic\nneglect of its articulation is a remiss, since there is an obvious need to specify its\nfeatures and discuss them. Now, how should we decide whether our chosen initial\nbasic axiom is strong enough? Should it perhaps also be not too strong? And then,\neven if we find that our chosen axiom is strong enough but not too strong, then we\nmay ask, is it unique? If it is, then we can eschew fideism even in the light of the tu-\nquoque argument \u2013 as unnecessary: the constraint to classical rationalism imposed on\nit by the tu-quoque argument then leaves no room for any arbitrariness and it then\nbecomes eminently rational as the most efficient means to rescue rationality.\nThis move is very welcome, as it dispenses with the most undesirable corollary\nto fideism, namely, the claim that there are different and equally legitimate kinds of\nrationalism, depending on one's pre-logical choice of one's initial basic axiom, and\nthat the validity of each is constrained by its alternatives. What is said here may be\ntrue or false, but it is a way out of the predicament of classical rationalism that is not\nfideist in the usual sense of the word, as it employs the tu-quoque argument without\nconceding the arbitrary choice of any axiom.\nThe undesirable corollary just mentioned was praised by the great fideist and\nmystic anthropologist Sir Edward Evans-Pritchard as most desirable. This makes his\nfideism not so arbitrary. Any defense of the choice of an initial basic axiom will then\nbe rational. And then it is better to take as the initial basic axiom Russell's celebrated\nproposal.  Another proposal, perhaps even better, was introduced by Popper in\nChapter 24 of his classic The Open Society and Its Enemies of 1945: the belief that\ncriticism bespeaks progress. He called this &#34;the faith in reason&#34; and characterized it\nas the minimal required deviation from comprehensive rationalism. Russell hoped\nthat his a priori supposition would permit reinstatement of classical rationalism in\nsome attenuation; Popper offered a fully-fledged new theory of rationality as\ndisproof. If any suggestion for an initial basic axiom is acceptable, then a theory of\nrationality is possible such that it is neither classical nor fideist, and this regardless of\nwhether the proof or disproof is taken to be the criterion of rationality. The claim is\nthat the arbitrariness of the initial choice does not follow from the tu-quoque\nargument, so that it can be made quite rationally.\nIf classical rationalism is to be fully restored, however, it is not enough to\nqualify it rationally: proof has to be shown possible. If it is, then an example will\nestablish this possibility. Is there any? It is easy to adduce proofs, and even of diverse\nkinds, mathematical, scientific, and legal: for convictions in murder trials evidence\nshould establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and at times it is declared achieved.\nSkeptics and advocates of fideism admit that such proofs exist. The question is the\nsame as, would such proofs be acceptable to Descartes as valid? We do not quite\nknow what kind of proof would satisfy Descartes, and probably he himself did not\nknow that either. To restrict the discussion to mathematics will not do; he would not\nagree to this. Also, this would not help as controversy still surrounds the question,\nwhat are proofs in mathematics? Descartes did offer a criterion for valid proof, but it\nis unclear and by now abandoned. To be clear about what valid proof comprises, a\ntheory of proof is required. But then, naturally, whatever this theory will turn out to\nbe, it will be question-begging. It is this very observation that led to the ancient\nskeptic conclusion that proof is impossible. Hence [classical] rationality, too, is\nimpossible. So, the followers of Pyrrho, the Pyrrhonists, suggested that one should\nnever adopt any view, that one should always suspend judgment. Fideism is not any\nphilosophy that takes some initial axiom for granted: most philosophies do so.\nFideism is the endorsement of the skeptical critique of classical rationalism as\nlogically unassailable, plus the refusal to abide by the proposal to suspend all\njudgments or the observation that no one can follow this proposal. Advocates of\nfideism declare the only way out of skepticism the initial endorsement of some basic\naxiom prior to the acceptance of the rationalist canons of proof. Taking this last\nsentence seriously one may see that whether the proposals of Russell and of Popper\nare satisfactory or not, they have unquestionably rendered a great service by refuting\nthis fideist assertion: feasible or not, they show the existence of alternatives that are\nnot as arbitrary. They have thus sensitized us to the inconsistency of the advocates of\nfideism who defend their initial basic axioms, and even without stating them\nexplicitly.\n2. Between Fideism and Critical Rationalism\nThe question, which axiom to endorse, seems to advocates of fideism beside the\npoint: as the choice of an initial basic axiom is arbitrary in the sense that (for logical\nreasons) it is pre-rational and so not rational. Here some doubt as to the sincerity of\ncontrary notwithstanding.\nadvocates of fideism may be raised: how come they usually endorse the faith of their\nfathers, whatever this happens to be? They retort that this choice is the most\nconvenient. This sounds as if convenience is the supreme criterion of choice.\nMoreover, which choice is more convenient invites the investigations that they\nforego. One may try for comfort different initial basic axioms one after the other:\ntake as an initial axiom the thesis that repetition renders choice progressively\nintelligent and reasonable. This kind of conduct, and the decision to adopt it, is\nrational. The best variant of fideism, then, the one closest to the fideist own mode of\nreasoning, is to make a basic decision afresh each day. Advocates of fideism may\nreject this as it is inconvenient, but then, criteria for convenience as well as feels for\nit are no initial axioms and so they can be overruled. To conclude, even if fideism is\ntrue and an arbitrary choice of some initial axiom is required, it need not be final.\nSome existentialist philosophers say that a commitment to an initial axiom that is not\nlife-long is not serious. But to take seriousness as more compelling than intellectual\nprogress makes it one's initial basic axiom, and an inadmissible one at that, since it\nruns contrary to logic by blocking all criticism. Admitting this, however, demands\nthat every candidate for initial basic axiom should prove irrefutable.\nAdvocates of fideism ignore the range of choice of initial axioms to employ as\nthe basis of rational thought, possibly because most of them are traditionalists and\nonce they succeed to reconcile their traditional faith with rationalism they are content.\nIf so, then this is their initial basic axiom: they are traditionalists and rationalists. Is\ntheir choice arbitrary? Some of them endorse their traditions without examination;\nothers defend them in the name of social stability, and of these, Evans -Pritchard and\nothers, conclude that different traditions hold for different societies. They defend\nrationalism while rejecting the classical Cartesian hostility to tradition.\nAll this is conjecture, which is thus suspect, especially since finding any\nrationale to the fideist initial basic axiom deprives it of its arbitrariness and so of its\nvery fideism. But then, whenever advocates of fideism argue for their fusion of\ntradition and reason, they do so by defending their initial basic axiom \u2500 as arbitrary\nor otherwise \u2500 they are advocates of fideism no longer.\nMost non-religious advocates of fideism are pragmatists; they advocate faith in\nscience for practical reasons. This invites a careful distinction between pragmatists\nproper and pragmatist advocates of fideism: the former view usefulness as the basic\ncriterion for belief in any opinion; they deem utility the ground of belief: according\nto them rationality is not proof but usefulness. Hence, like Popper, they offer a non-\nclassical, theory of rationality and so they are not advocates of fideism at all. Hence,\nthe best criticism of pragmatism proper is the observation that in order to decide what\nidea is useful we need some workable criterion of rational decision between the\noptions that the choice of this or that hypothesis is most useful. Advocates of fideism\ndo not claim that utility or any other criterion is a criterion of rationality; rather, they\ntake it as the initial basic axiom that is chosen prior to being rational, as the\nprecondition for it; other than that, they adhere to the classical view of rationality as\nproof, and so the strong criticism of pragmatism just voiced does not apply to their\nview. One may, of course, suggest that the initial choice of rationality is not useful,\nbut this is an initial basic axiom, a dogma not subject to critical debate.\nToday taking science to be the most useful set of beliefs to advocate is\nextremely popular. Its popularity suggests that possibly behind it stands mental\nlaziness plus the hypothesis that following the majority is most convenient. This is no\nfideism. Nor is the thoughtless adherence to the majority view, nor is the view of one\nwho has never examined one\u2019s views and who does not know what exactly it is. It\nmay but need not be fideist proper. It is clear that these differ; the question is, does\nthis difference make a practical difference? A difference, to be a [real] difference,\nsaid arch-pragmatist William James, must make a [practical] difference. Is there a\npractical difference between pragmatism proper and pragmatist fideism?\nAt least this should be observed: the tu-quoque argument makes it clear that\nthose who use it view us all as advocates of fideism at heart, whether we know it or\nnot; and then even if everyone behave in the fideist manner, the advocates of fideism\nare still practically better off as they possess a greater self-awareness. But surely,\nwhether this is so or not is both forever question-begging and empirically decidable,\nwhich is absurd.\nPragmatists have replaced proof with utility as the criterion of rationality.\nOther criteria may be proof-substitutes too. Each of them may serve as an alternative\nto the classical theory of rationality or as a fideist basis for the quasi-classical one.\nThis depicts the whole scheme in a new way. For, now the question is generalized:\npragmatists or others who take utility or any other quality as their supreme criterion,\ndo they use it repeatedly and eschew proof proper, or do they use it initially and then\nrequire proof? Is theirs an alternative rationalist view or is it a quasi-rationalist one?\nThis is a big difference, as it is procedural and so it effects almost every deliberation:\ndeliberations may employ proof (though on the basis of an arbitrarily chosen axiom)\nand they may employ an altogether different criterion of rationality.\nThis reasoning may expose pragmatism as a version of fideism; it also exposes\nadvocates of fideism as rationalists for all intents and purpose, as long their initial\nbasic choice of rationalism is not challenged. Their discussions can, perhaps also\nshould, be scrutinized as to whether or not, in addition to their axioms, advocates of\nfideism usually advocate the demand for proof. Now, clearly, almost all discussions\nincorporate some initial hypotheses, except for Descartes' radical thought experiment\nand its alternatives, all of which are now judged unavoidably failures. Hence, there is\nno practical difference between the fideist mode of arguing and other, except for one:\nwhenever what they happen to consider their initial basic axioms happens to be\nchallenged, they refuse to discuss it. Here, all of a sudden, the tu-quoque argument\nbreaks down and drops out of the picture. Contrary to it, there is a basic difference\nbetween the fideist and others: we all exempt some dogma from the demand to\nexamine it rationally, but the advocates of fideism exempt their own dogma\nconsciously and systematically and for good. This is a great self-awareness, and one\nthat they might naturally take pride of. It turns out to be their awareness of their\nirrevocable commitment to a dogma, and as a necessity. But this turns out to be a\nmistake: there are better ways to handle the situation.\nThe very use of the tu-quoque argument rests on error: it is used as an excuse\nto exempt from rational scrutiny some unspecified view, on the basis of the\nobservation that usually we all do so (since the skeptic critique of classical\nrationalism is valid). But we all do so now and then, whereas advocates of fideism do\nso come-what-may. This is why the suggestion to keep one's initial axiom floating is\nso deadly to fideism; its hidden assumption is that their retreat to commitment is a\nleap of faith in the sense of Kierkegaard, as Bartley has discovered.\nBartley saw the situation this way: taking the tu-quoque argument as support\nfor fideism is placing it on the borderline between rationalism and irrationalism and\ninvites efforts to refute it: its refutation is required not for irrationalists but for\nrationalists. He was in error: the tu-quoque argument is but a variant on the skeptic\ncritique. Even were it unanswerable, it would remain better to take reason upon faith\nthan to be defensive about some proper dogma. This point belongs to Popper. It is\nlovely. In his effort to dodge Bartley\u2019s criticism he lost it. pity.\nThis is no defense of classical rationalism, of course, since the skeptic critique\nof it as question-begging is taken here as valid, even if only as a working hypothesis;\nthis is to dismiss the fideist critique as no boost for it. This dismissal holds equally\nfor classical rationalism and to any other variant. To make this evident, let us\nconsider the idea of the ancient Pyrrhonist school, the view that one can live w ithout\nadherence to any view, with total and permanent suspension of judgment, and that\nthe practice of the suspension of judgment provides peace of mind (ataraxia). This is\nquestionable, but let this ride and let us ask, is Pyrrhonism fideist? Possibly, as a\nmatter of fact, every school has an initial basic axiom. Even were this true, as neither\nschool has noted this, it is hard to decide which of the two schools is nearer to\nfideism, the Pyrrhonists or the classical rationalists. That there is a great practical\ndifference between them, however, is all too clear. Hence, the tu-quoque argument\nmakes no practical difference even between skeptics and classical rationalists, though\nthe skeptical argument clearly does.\nI know Popper and Bartle agreed that they d isagreed; I do not know on what.\nPerhaps Popper has offered a new comprehensive theory of rationality that is less\nquestion-begging than comprehensive classical rationalism, perhaps not; Bartley\nclaimed that he did and that Popper did not; but then perhaps both did and perhaps\nneither did. If both did, and if both did not, are the views of the two identical? For\nuncontested background information, the very demand for openness to criticism is\ntaken for granted. Popper\u2019s innovation that Bartley endorsed but that is still the\nminority view is the assertion that this demand suffices for rationality, including the\nrationality of science. Popper's theory of rationality is very far-reaching, and is far\nfrom obvious. Bartley found it admirable but defective in not being comprehensive.\n3. Between Popper and Bartley\nscience Adolf Gr\xfcnbaum who calls himself neo-Baconian and denies Popper his originality.\nWhereas classical rationalism broke down because it is comprehensive, fideism is\npainful because it is not. Hence, rejecting both amounts to rejectingwhat they share:\nthe idea that rationality is proof. Consider, then, critical rationalism, the idea that\nrationality is disproof. Can we not show both options of it, qualified and\ncomprehensive, likewise painful? Can we apply the skeptical argument to\ncomprehensive critical rationalism and find it wanting, and then to apply the\nrationalist critique of fideism to qualified critical rationalism, and then be done with\nit altogether? Let me defeat this program.\nConsider first the application of classical rationalism to critical rationalism\n(qualified or comprehensive). This way critical rationalism fails of course. This has\nbeen showed repeatedly in the literature, yet it is trivial. Moreover, this is offered as\nfatal criticism, yet it is no criticism at all: there is no reason why critical rationalism\nshould submit to the rules of classical rationalism. Should it be applied to itself\ninstead? That classical rationalism should be proven by its own light is clear. But\ncritical rationalism should be held open to criticism, perhaps, or else it should be\nqualified. Here possibly Popper and Bartley disagreed. What is the reasoning here?\nCan we discuss this matter without begging the question?\nThe claim that logic is obligatory is inherent in the history of the debate over\nrationality. Hence, it is not contested that the aim of criticism is to refute its object.\nFrom the very start Popper stressed that he never adjudicated the matter of the\nsuccess of each piece of criticism, that all he said in general was no more than what\nlogic requires: if and when a piece of criticism is judged successful, then it is thereby\nalso judged as having refuted its object. To repeat, Popper offers as a solution to the\nproblem of rationality not a logical truth, but a conjecture, the novel theory that\ndisproof suffices for the advancement of knowledge in general and of science in\nparticular. How does he know that disproof suffices? He does not; it is his conjecture.\nQuery: is it rational to advocate this presupposition, this initial basic axiom? Can\nthere be a critical debate of it? If not, it seems fideist; if yes, it seems comprehensive.\nWhich is it?\nAssume that we must choose some initial basic axiom; how can the choice be\nrational? Given Popper's theory of rationality as openness to criticism, the answer to\nthis question is obvious: to the extent that it is criticizable and open to criticism, it is.\nDoes this apply to Popper's own choice? Should a critical rationalist be open-minded\nabout being open-minded? This is hard to say. Let us try to do so by splitting critical\nrationalism into two theses, one minor, one major, so that the question splits into two\nas well. The minor thesis is that criticism is binding. Is it? In other words, is logic\nbinding? The major thesis is that disproof suffices for intellectual progress. Is it? Till\nnow adherence to logic was taken for granted; nevertheless, possibly, comprehensive\ncritical rationalism requires an examination of our commitment to logic.\nAlready Plato asked, how binding is logic? In the end of his Phaedo,\ndescribing Socrates' last minutes, he ascribes to him the refusal to give up reason;\nnothing, Socrates seems to say, will sway him away from logic: he will never be a\nmysologist: even in his last hour he will gladly accept criticism. It is hard to say\nwhether this reading of the text is right, since the question is intricate. But Popper's\ntext seemed to me clear enough \u2500 until he declared Bartley's reading of it erroneous:\nI then began to doubt my reading of his text. For a lark, however, let me cling to my\nold reading of his text, as examining a view is more important than its authorship.\n(Besides, the first author of qualified critical rationalism is anyway Plato or Heinrich\nHeine.) To avoid all misconception of my motive, let me repeat: this discussion is no\ndefense of Popper or of Bartley, since I dissent from both.\nPlato's insistence on open-mindedness, his refusal to be open-minded about it,\nseems to identify rationality with logic. This is not clear, especially since formal\nlogic was invented later, and since it was not satisfactory till the twentieth century, if\never. So logic was open to criticism. Is it still? If yes, can its authority be revoked? In\nother words, can there be a critical debate on the rationality of logic, and if it is found\ndefective, can it be taken for granted? This depends on what we mean by the demand\nto reject a refuted version of it. If it is the demand to improve logic, then yes; if it is\nthe demand to jettison it, then no. Hence, in the broad sense logic is not given to\nrational deliberations, and so it is the initial axiom of rationality. Yet, in the narrow\nsense logic is very much given to rational deliberations, and this is expressed in the\nperennial efforts to improve it. (This seems to be the major thrust of the critique of\nthe view of logic as above criticism that we usually ascribe to Van Quine.)\nThis holds for all possible versions of the theory of rationality, since, to repeat,\ndiscussion of it was always conducted within logic. And then, Popper's claim that\nrationality is not comprehensive can be seen (not as a concession to fideism but) as\nmaking explicit a point that was traditionally taken for granted and that the modern\nhistory of logic makes its explicit statement desirable: the broad commitment to logic\ninvites efforts at its improvement in detail. Once this is noted, the discussion of\ncomprehensiveness has to be recast in a more precise manner. For example, the\nadvocates of fideism' commitment to their tradition is less irrational if it is only a\nbroad commitment, while being open-minded about any detail of it. (This is no small\ndifference, as it replaces the refusal to engage in intellectual traffic between different\ntraditions with a proposal to have it, at least up to a point, but the point is movable.)\nPopper has advocated this attitude to tradition in his classic if neglected 1947\n&#34;Towards a Rational Theory of Tradition&#34; [Popper, 1963].\nWith more due care, then, Bartley's comprehensiveness may read, his\ncommitment to logic is rational since he is open to its critical assessment. The same\nholds for Popper, of course. Where, then, is the difference between qualified and\ncomprehensive critical rationalism? Perhaps the difference lies in the disagreement\nabout the major thesis, the thesis that the engagement in critical debates suffices for\nthe advancement of learning. Since criticism involves logic, the discussion of the\nmajor thesis involves the minor one, but we need not go over this ground again.\nSuppose that the thesis that criticism suffices for progress is refuted, then. What will\nthis suggest to critical rationalists? Again, it seems, it will invite an improvement, not\na total overthrow. This seems to be the attitude advocated and practiced by both\nattitudes. So how do they differ?\nThis is not an idle thought. Critical rationalism was criticized both ways: once\n\u2500 by Feyerabend and myself \u2500 with the observation that at times the suspension of\ncriticism (at least for a lark) is wise (as Popper admitted citing Galileo to that effect)\nand once \u2500 by myself \u2500 with the observation that scholasticism was critical but not\nprogressive. The reason for this defect is clear: scholastic criticism was conducted\nwithin a given framework that was not given to criticism; this was done consciously,\non the ground of the view that debates have to be limited by some initial basic axio m,\nvery much in the fideist manner. Popper was aware of this: in his early work he\ndemanded that the most theory most given to criticism should be examined first, and\nhe later criticized the scholastic theory, which he called &#34;the myth of the framework&#34;.\nHe was thus unclear if not inconsistent. The way to overcome the inconsistency is to\nspeak of maximal criticism instead of criticism when wording the thesis of critical\nrationalism. Popper suggested that the demand for maximal openness to criticism\nwill eliminate, or at least sufficiently prevent, the use of ad hoc hypotheses, as there\nreduce the level of openness to criticism of hypotheses.\nExcept that this was criticized too \u2500 also by myself. Many theories in\ntechnology are very open to criticism yet are very much ad hoc; efforts to put them to\ntest are made repeatedly, as they are of great technological value. Yet they are not\ndeemed intellectually as interesting as the scarcely testable theories that are on the\nforefront of theoretical research. Since critical rationalism does not differentiate\nbetween pure and applied research, it demands improvement. This holds for Popper\nand for Bartley equally.\nSince qualified critical rationalism demands openness to criticism not only in\nthe abstract but also as exhibited in the possibility of a concrete criticism, in the high\nrisk of the theory in question, Bartley could ask Popper, how great should this risk be\nbefore it is deemed great enough? Popper had an answer to this question already in\n1935, but only as far as science is concerned: the risk is measured there by the\nlikelihood of an experiment that can be designed and performed to refute the theory\nin question; this likelihood can be measured by some extant alternative or by\ncommon sense. But Popper himself admitted in 1945 that weaker kinds of criticism\nare possible, in history and in philosophy, including ethics. How much should the\nrisk be a real one? (Significantly, Bartley took seriously the weak criticism that\npseudo-intellectual sects directed against the established commonwealth of learning.\nHe suggested [Bartley, 1990, 100] that since the academy is so very dogmatic, these\nfleeting intellectual clusters are where the action really is. This view is intriguing but\nalas not serious.) Nor is that all. Popper spent much of his effort arguing that\ncriticism is beneficial, which should be incontestable, and that the theory of\nrationality as the critical attitude does not suffer from the skeptical critique. Bartley\non his part spent much time arguing that since critical rationalism is not hit by the\nskeptic critique it can be held comprehensively. But they both argued prematurely,\noverlooking the critical examination of the claim that they perform the task for which\nthey were designed.\nThe question that the classical theory of rationality came to answer is, what\ntheory should be believed? Critical rationalists refuse to answer this question, as it\nprefers the diversity of opinions. Rather, it comes to exclude the theories that are not\nreasonable to believe, beginning with traditional local myths. The wish to promote\nthe progress of science is better than the wish to believe in current science. Proof\ndoes not do it; does disproof? No; critical rationalism never guaranteed success. Can\nit at least explain success? No; explanation amounts to guarantee: to say that A is\ncaused by B is to guarantee the presence of A in the presence of B. Critical\nrationalism guarantees not the success in providing conjectures and their criticism,\nbut that when these are present, progress obtains. How? The answer is what makes\ncritical rationalism so very intriguing: criticism is not the cause of intellectual\nprogress; it is intellectual progress. This, however, is a new conception of progress,\nand it can be challenged. We have not shed light this way on an important matter:\nwhy is the Popper-Bartley dispute important? In answer to this Bartley said,\nerroneously, because the tu-quoque argument is a serious challenge. This challenge\nmay signify at most for critical rationalism, not for science proper.\n4. Rationality as Partial and as Social\nWe see again that the discussion requires better presentation. Let us begin with\nrationality, whatever it is. Rationality as proof is an all-or-nothing affair; criticism is\npossibly more graded. Consider it a matter of degree. I. C. Jarvie and I have\nintroduced this idea decades ago. The measure of the degree of rationality, we\nsuggest, is not some abstract scale but depends on the available intellectual tools. It is\nclear, we said, that for one living in a preliterate society the most rational act and\nattitude will be much inferior to that available to one living in a society familiar with\nscience. This enters the social dimens ion into the debate, and so it really needs going\nover and, when necessary, recast. This is no small matter. Traditionally the options\navailable to social philosophy were individualism and collectivism. As collectivism\nnaturally distrusts individual reason as disruptive, it tends to be irrationalist.\nIndividualism then ruled the debate on rationality. And as individuals depend on\nsociety to this or that extent, though not wholly, their rationality should be cast in\nsocial terms and then viewed as partial.\nTo take a simple example, whereas traditional advocates of fideism discussed\nthe matter of rationality in an individualist framework, they could hardly answer the\nquestion, how should I choose my initial axioms? They did not have clear instances\nof initial axioms, and it looked as if infinitely many alternatives are available. Asking\nthe question in a social manner it becomes the question of the choice of a community,\nand there are a few communities to join; moreover, one cannot change communities\nevery week, and so, for merely technical reasons, one must live on one so as to\nacquire is basic tenets. It was stressed by Michael Polanyi, that when one joins a\ncommunity one scarcely knows what it has to offer, especially if the community in\nquestion is the scientific community, and that when one learns the initial basic\naxioms one may find that they are not given to simple articulation. He stressed,\nhowever, that one can belong to more than one community without fear of\ncontradiction. He did not elaborate. Another historical example should serve as\nevidence of the defect of the abstract discussion that Popper still participated in: the\nold scholastic tradition is not considered as rational as the new scientific tradition\n(even on the supposition that the old gave birth to the young). I skip the details here.\nAs long as science plays the role of a paradigm of rational activity, the\nindividual is most rational when joining the scientific community. Popper has\nsuggested that science is a social institution, one that encourages criticism. He also\nsuggested that parliamentary democracy is such a paradigm, and the same holds for\nthat paradigm. That there may be inconsistency between science and democracy, as\nwell as within each, is no reason for defection, as it may be a challenge for efforts to\nimprove. Popper said, the reason for these being paradigms of rationality is that\nrationality is the effort to improve through criticism.\nCan we rephrase the Popper-Bartley dispute within a social framework? All\ntheories of rationality recommend joining actively the life of science and of\ndemocracy. The view of rationality as improvable goes better with critical\nrationalism than with classical rationalism. Is here a significant difference between\nPopper and Bartley? Can we rephrase Bartley's philosophy socially? I do not know.\nThe critical attitude commends both a personal openness to criticism and an\ninstitutional setup that encourages criticism and is open to reform. The criticism of an\ninstitution, or of an institutionalized opinion, however, is not the same as the\ncriticism of an individual's opinion: the one is a personal matter, the other is social.\nValid criticism should always lead one to the search of alternatives, and reform is\naccepted not after criticism is voiced and endorsed but after a viable alternative is\nfound and tested in instituted manners. What this means for Popper is clear enough:\nboth democracy and science are open to reform. What does this mean for Bartley\nabove and beyond what it means to Popper I cannot see. Perhaps this means that\npossibly democracy and/or science will be criticized in a new manner that will lead\nto a proposal of a totally new regime and/or research protocol and Bartley will be\nwilling to test it. Whether this is so or not is hard to say: the discussion becomes too\nabstract here.\nBibliography\nAgassi, Joseph, 1981.

 u"Michael S. Myslobodsky, ed.,\nThe Mythomanias: The Nature of Deception and Self -deception.\nHillsdale NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, 1996, pp. 23-50.\nDeception: A View from the Rationalist Perspective\nBy Joseph Agassi,\nTel Aviv University and York University, Toro nto\nSelf- Deception in General\n&#34;A Liberal Decalogue&#34; suggests (Russell, 1967, pp. 60-61) not\nto envy people who live in a fool's paradise: It is a place only\nfor fools. This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's\nparadise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of\nopinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down,\nthat reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when\nall is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of\ntheir situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to\nget them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is\nlittle that can be done about it, except that the wise would still\nprefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic\nmore constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the\nreassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable\nalternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - -\nso that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to\nmobilize some appropriate action.\nAlternatively, fools may tell themselves that there is no risk.\nThis is self- deception, and the question is, why do people\ndeceive themselves and take risks? To take a concrete\nexample, people with weak hearts may avoid taking precautions\nand prefer to live like normal people and risk instant death\nfrom heart failure. This is possibly a rational choice. Yet some\nwho suffer from weak hearts pretend, even to themselves, that\nthey are normal. It is hard then to say whether they have\nchosen to live normally and take the risk. Perhaps they prefer\nto take precautions, and yet do not do so because they are\nunable to look the risk straight in the face.\nMore sophisticated ways of living in a fool's paradise are\nknown. One may live there knowingly. One may feel that one\ndoes not share the reassuring received opinion, yet pretend\nthat one does. This is what Russell warned against: Anyone\nwho knowingly chooses to live in a fool's paradise is still a fool.\nAnyone who thinks that awareness of one's living in a fool's\nparadise immunizes one to its dangers is a fool. This is self-\ndeception about one's ability to cope with deceit. Many\nphilosophers have noted that people who habitually deceive\nfinally fall for their own deceptions. This is the well-known\nphenomenon that confidence artists appeal to the willingness of\ntheir victims to deceive both themselves and others in one and\nthe same act: The victims are encouraged to deceive\nthemselves into thinking that they deceive only others while\nignoring their own greed and the immorality of the way they\nchoose to satisfy it. To this Russell added that the same holds\ntrue for all self -deception: Those who think they can live in\nsituation of self-deception without deceiving themselves finally\nfall for their own self-deception. The seemingly wise deceive\nthemselves that they only pretend that they endorse the\nreassuring hypothesis: They do not know the cost of the\npretense, which is the neglect of thinking out the viable\nalternatives.\nThe reason one endorses the reassuring hypothesis despite\nattempts to immunize oneself is complex. It is in part\nintellectual: One does not invest in the examination of\nalternative hypotheses. It is in part social: One cannot discuss\nalternative possibilities when one pretends to the world that\none is committed to the reassuring hypothesis. It is in part\npsychological: One is ambivalent about matters, and one\nreassures oneself that one does not need the reassurance.\nThe case of self- deception, in brief, is complex. It involves\nerror, impatience in thinking out detailed matters,\nunwillingness to examine each and every obvious option, and\nalso deception proper. Yet clearly something is missing here: It\nis fear and obsession. As Freud was first to notice, self-\ndeception usually rests on the stubborn reluctance to consider\nalternatives when these are suggested by others.\nNot all cases of self -deception, however, are cases of life in\nfool's paradise. This phenomenon is usually associated with the\nself-deception that involves whole social groups. The social\ncase is more complex than the personal case. The personal\ncase of self -deception is puzzling because its victims refuse to\nconsider corrections suggested by their environment. The case\nof the fool's paradise that is group self -deception, usually\nnational, is different and more complex: A whole society\ndeclares a certain option not open to public discussion. Its\ngiven rationale is that it is dangerous to discuss different\noptions -- because it will help other people or discourage our\npeople. Indeed, it is very similar to the case of the confidence\nartist: The group (national) leadership suggests that, although\nour case may be shaky, we may be able to succeed if it will be\nnevertheless accepted, and for this it should be presented with\nfull confidence. All that is missing from the picture to complete\nit are two true observations. First, many political leaders are\nconfidence tricksters, and they see themselves as such.\nSecond, confidence tricksters make a profession of deceiving\nthemselves that they deceive only others. In principle, the n,\nthe difference between the two cases -- the private and the\npublic -- is only technical: Both are cases of reluctance -- of\nnot allowing oneself to examine views that deserve to be\nexamined, where an excuse for this reluctance is left\nunexamined as well . The two cases differ as to the excuse\noffered for the reluctance. To make the difference purely\ntechnical, what is needed is to observe, as is explained in detail\nhere, that any effort to present a case authoritatively -- be it\npersonal, social, politica l, or intellectual -- is in itself nothing\nshort of self-deception.\nIn summary, when one deceives oneself, one does not know the\ncost of the self -deception, and it is usually this that makes the\nerror significant. In other words, however irrational any c ase of\nself-deception looks, when one unpacks it, one finds it not very\nproblematic. The inability to see this rests on a difficulty that\nenters the picture with the introduction of a theory of\nrationality. Two important theories of rationality are found in\nWestern philosophy. The earlier of the tow is the more\nimportant. It was known as the rationlist theory, and now it is\nknown as classical rationalism. It identifies rational action with\none based on rational belief and rational belief as that which\nrests on proof of sorts (Agassi, 1986a; Agassi &amp; Jarvie, 1987,\nChapter 16.) The other important theory is romanticism: It\nidentifies rational action with one based on strong intuition:\nOne acts rationally when one is true to one's inner self, when\none listens to the right inner voice. This theory, be it true or\nfalse, is not given to rational discussion for the following\nreason. There is only one argument against it: By listening to\none's inner voice, one can make tragic decisions. The followers\nof the romantic theory of rationality are not dissuaded by this\nargument for reasons that are good or bad. Whatever is the\ntruth of the matter, the followers of the romantic theory are\nunshakable. Hence, there is no point in pursuing this discussion\nunless and until someone comes up with a new suggestion (for\ndetails see Agassi, 1982).\nThe rest of this chapter is devoted to a discussion of the\nclassical theory of rationality and of its implications for the\ncase of self -deception. At the end, a new avenue for the theory\no f rationality is highlighted. The newer theory of rationality is\nmore commonsensical, as it takes rationality to be a matter of\ntrial and error. Thus, it permits the discussion to proceed along\nthe lines suggested here.\nRationality and the Social Order\nThe prevalence of self -deception is part of folk knowledge; it is\nthe target of a rich folk literature, and of more sophisticated\nliterature as well. It has not puzzled people, however, until the\nadvent of modern times. The reason is not far to seek: The\nphenomenon began to puzzle people when it conflicted with\nreceived opinion and/or when it constituted a challenge that\nwas surprisingly hard to meet. The surprising difficulty\npresented by a challenge testifies to the presence of a theory\nin the light of which it should be easily met. The theory that\nhuman beings are rational is the source of the trouble:\nObviously, self -deception is not rational.\nAs long as the received opinion was that human beings are\nfoolish, or unreasonable, it was expected that they sho uld\nbehave erratically, deceive themselves, and so on. Clearly, this\ntraditionally received opinion was an unavoidable corollary to\nthe traditionally received religious doctrines of the Western\nworld prior to modern times: The wages of sin are slight and\nmomentary and the cost of sin is eternal damnation; Hence\nnothing is more rational than to behave properly. Yet people\nwill sin (&#34;the flesh is weak&#34;). The prevalence of sin was taken\nby all the traditionally received religious doctrines of the\nWestern world prior to modern times as conclusive evidence of\nhuman irrationality.\nThe situation was taken quite differently by most of the modern\nrationalistic philosophers, the classical rationalists: They\nconsidered the prevalence of sin to be evidence that sinners\nsimply do not believe in eternal damnation. They reasoned\nthus: Rational people act in accord with their beliefs; people do\nnot act in accord with the belief that their actions will lead to\neternal damnation; hence, clearly, they do not believe in\neternal damnation. Moreover, the classical rationalists taught\nthat it is important to hold the right beliefs. To this end, beliefs\nshould be adopted rationally, and then all will be as well as can\nbe expected. Self-deception, however, does not fit the classical\nrationalist prescription: Classical rationalists always viewed it\nas the willful deviation from rational belief. Its prevalence,\nthen, is, or seems to be, a refutation of their theory of rational\nbelief. Hence its centrality for their theory of rationality -- for\nthe theory of rationality presented in the classical rationalist\ntradition (Agassi, 1977, 1991).\nThis last point deserves a slight elaboration. Practically all\nWestern religious traditions and practically all folk wisdom\nconstantly preach the restraint of natural human appetites on\nthe ground of the (false) observation that selfish conduct\nobviously undermines social stability. The classical (Western)\ntradition of rationalist philosophy disagreed with this teaching\nand rejected this observation (as obviously the very opposite of\nthe truth). It declared any desirable restraint better achieved\nby reasonable, self- reliant individuals than by those frightened\nby hell fire and brimstone. Classical rationalists preferred, on\nthe whole, not to prescribe restraint. They did not deny that\nsome restraint is reasonable. Yet they considered particularly\nerroneous the demand to avoid greed and selfishness. The\nreasonable, self- reliant individual, they taught, will practice the\nnecessary self- restraint anyway. The end of rational conduct is\nalways selfish, as action comes to satisfy the natural appetites\nof actors. Hence, the best way to act, the best way to achieve\none's end, is to behave intelligently - - to act as a reasonable\nself- reliant individual (Agassi, 1 986b).\nIn brief, the classical (Western) tradition of rationalist\nphilosophy rejected as too strict the preaching of (Western)\nreligious traditions and folk wisdom for the restraint of natural\nhuman appetites. Its preached reasonable self- reliance, on the\nopposite view that reasonable, self- reliant individuals are\nbetter able to judge how strict their conduct should be.\nRational action is best guided by thought; Hence, the problem\nof rationality is less a question of the choice of a mode of\nconduct and more the question of the choice of the right belief\nto endorse. The problem then can be limited, at least initially,\nto rational belief.\nThe 17th- and 18th-century rationalist philosophers were\nliberals. They learned to argue against the traditional religio u s\nrequirement for strictness, which was based on the observation\nthat the unintended social consequences of selfish action are\nsocially undesirable. The liberal philosophers suggested, on the\ncontrary, that some social conditions ensure that the\nunintend ed social consequences of selfish action are socially\ndesirable. Under such conditions, then, following natural\nappetites, selfish actions will (unintentionally) support social\nstability rather than undermine it. If so, instead of preaching to\ncurb natural human appetites by the threat of hell fire and\nbrimstone and eternal damnation, it is wiser to create\nconditions that will make selfish conduct socially beneficial:\nThe readiness to act selfishly is more reliable than the\nreadiness to curb selfish motives merely out of fear (Gellner,\n1992, 1995, p. 8.)\nInitially, in the 17th and 18th centuries, the theory of\nrationality was prescriptive rather than descriptive. It became\ndescriptive in the 19th and 20th centuries, with the advent of\nmodern social science . It was recognized then that it is well\nworth investigating the facts of the matter, to observe what\nactions some extant ideas bespeak, and how. This created a\nneed to distinguish explicitly between the two kinds of\nrationality: (a) the intellectual ratio nal choice, the choice of\nbeliefs or of opinions to endorse; (b) the practical rational\nchoice, the choice of the right conduct. This distinction is\nbriefly denoted as the choice between rational thought and\nrational action, or that between thought and action. The need\nto make this distinction explicit was first presented in modern\nsociology. It usually goes by the name of Max Weber, one of\nthe acknowledged fathers of that field, who made his studies at\nthe end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th cent uries.\nNow the classical rationalist assumption is that action is guided\nby thought, and rationally this is done as best as possible.\nHence, the problem of rationality can be limited, at least\ninitially, to the problem of rational thought: What opinions\nshould one endorse? What is rational to believe in? What\ncriterion of choice of a belief should one endorse? The best\nsolutions to these questions, the classical rationalists taught,\nwill ensure the best solutions to all problems.\nRationality and Self- reliance\nQuestion: why did the classical rationalists find it so important\nto insist that, by the classical rationalist recipe, all is as well as\ncan be expected?\nAnswer: Because throughout the history of classical\nrationalism, its adherents have opposed the re ligious doctrine\nthat humans are evil and replaced it with the classical\nrationalist gospel of self- reliance as the road to salvation\n(Agassi, 1977).\nQuestion: If all is as well as can be expected, why is the world\nstill so frustrating, why are people so d isappointing as they\nare?\nAnswer: Because, says the classical rationalist, people are still\nnot self- reliant.\nQuestion: Why are people not self -reliant? What will make them\nso?\nAnswer: People are not self- reliant, says the classical\nrationalist, because they are captives of the [religious]\ndoctrines which they are taught, which makes them rely on\ntheir teachers. Only giving up these doctrines will enable\npeople to become self-reliant. After the act of giving up\nreceived opinions, beliefs will be as rational as can be expected\n(for more details see Agassi, 1991). The world may still not be\nperfect even when people will be as rational as possible, but it\nwill be as perfect as possible. This is the classical theory of\nrationality: Rational conduct will bring about the best of all\npossible worlds, says the classical rationalist, particularly\nbecause it will advance scientific research, and thus increase\nself-knowledge and self -reliance.\nIt was in this way that self -deception was integrated into the\nbroader system of the modern or classical rationalist\nmovement, or of the Enlightenment movement, or the moderns.\nSelf- deception, they taught, is irrational, and irrationality is\ndue to the absence of self- reliance, and this absence is due to\nlies with which one is ra ised. Members of this movement were\nhardly ever explicit about religion. Few of those who were\nreligiously skeptic dared hint at that fact. It only became\npermissible to refuse to assume the existence of God in the\nearly 19th century, after the demise of t hat movement, and\neven then there was no attack on established religion until the\nmid -19th century. Nevertheless, this much is clear: The\nundercurrent of the gospel of Enlightenment was that of self-\nreliance; the educational system was blamed for teaching ideas\nthat impede it. The education system was, of course, run and\ncarefully monitored largely by the religious establishment. In\nthe civilized world, this monopoly was broken by the French\nand American Revolutions, yet the monitoring of it by the\nreligious establishment still goes on there to this day. However,\nfew will blame the religious establishment for the widespread of\nirrationality.\nThe situation merits careful analysis. The basic classical\nrationalist tenet is this: Self -reliance is the reliance on reason;\ntherefore it is the same as rationality. It follows from this that\nself- reliance, or rationality, is the best guide to life. There is\nno substitute for thinking: Regardless of whether one is\nreligious, it was suggested, one should not rely on any church\nor leader. Some modern rationalist philosophers preached and\nstill preach religious self- reliance, of course (&#34;God helps those\nwho help themselves&#34;). Yet it was this idea that undermined\nthe authority of established churches and leaderships,\nregardless of whether and to what extent this authority was\nhostile to self -reliance.\nThe question then is, what is rationality? It was treated in a\nstandard way within the classical rationalist tradition, and its\ncurrent formulation is as follows. The question is first split into\ntwo: What is rational action? What is rational belief? The\nclassical rationalist tradition took it for granted that people\nalways act in accord with their beliefs; Otherwise they are\ncoerced by others, by the laws of the land, or by the laws of\nnature, and so they do not act freely, and so they do not really\nact. This is the distinction between action and behavior that\nentered the literature. (Behaviorism, accordingly, is the view\nthat people never act in this sense of the word -- tha t they are\nalways coerced to move as they do by the combination of the\ngeneral laws of nature and specific circumstances. The standard\nclassical rationalist view rejects this doctrine and takes for\ngranted as a fact the repeated observation that people do act.)\nAssuming, then, that people act, it follows that they act\nrationally. It then follows that if their beliefs are rationally\nheld, then their conduct is as good as can be reasonably\nexpected. This seems reasonable, and even commonsense. It is\ncommonsense, of course, only on the supposition that humans\nare naturally rational and self- reliant, that irrational conduct is\ndue to childhood indoctrination in unreasonable beliefs, and\nthat this indoctrination can be overcome for the asking. This\nmeans that peo ple are rational unless they are deceived. Why,\nthen, do people insist on being deceived? Why are people\ngullible? Classical rationalism offers no answer. This is the big\ngap in the classical rationalism of the Enlightenment\nmovement. This doctrine is still very popular, and so the gap is\nstill conspicuous.\nThus, the prevalence of self- deception is the major refutation\nto the doctrine of natural human rationality which is at the root\nof the doctrine of the Enlightenment movement. Moreover, all\ndeception is due to the fact that some of it is successful, and\nsuccessful deception is possible only because many people\nallow themselves to be deceived. Why do they? Because they\ndeceive themselves about other people's credibility. Admittedly,\nsince rational opinio n is at times erroneous, one may be\ndeceived without self-deception. Yet, since reason is the best\nguide, if the rationalist philosophy is true, it will prevent\nconstant systematic error. Systematic error is the result of\ninsistence on it, of the mistrust of reason, and so it is due to\nself-deception. Even the trust in the teaching and\nindoctrination during childhood is a form of self -deception. It is\npossible and rationally obligatory to give it up and be set free.\nYet people often cling to their education. They deceive\nthemselves to trust it. The question that classical rationalism\nhas to answer is, why then do people allow others to deceive\nthem systematically? According to classical rationalism, what\nprevents bridging the gulf between the best, which is the life of\nreason, and the real, which is the practice of systematic error,\nis self- deception alone. This phenomenon deserves special\nattention: It is any systematic error that cannot be viewed as\nanything other than self- deception: All effort to correct it are\nmet with unintelligent excuses.\nError and Sin\nThe ethics of the Enlightenment movement, of the modern\nphilosophy of life, is simple: &#34;Reason is and ought only to be,\nthe slave of the passions&#34;, as David Hume has aptly put it\n(Hume, 1980, Bk. 2, Pt. 3, Sec. 3). On this view, self- interest\nis the only right motive force for action, provided it employs\nreason to the full, which, of course, is eminently reasonable.\nHence, all sin is violation of self -interest, and so, at bottom, all\nsin is error. This is the doctrine of enlightened self-interest. It\nis scarcely new. In antiquity it was known as the Socratic\ndoctrine of eudaimony ('eu' is good and 'daimon' is spirit; the\nname refers to the story, narrated in Plato's The Apology of\nSocrates -- Socrates explains that he is the wisest by reporting\nthat he has a good Fairy Godmother who prevents him from\ndoing what he does not want to do, which is not good for him).\nThis doctrine is particularly hard to defend, since experience is\nmore in accord with the opposite doctrine, according to which\nhumans are both wicked and self-destructive. Thus, the moral\ndoctrine of classical rationalism appears to be empirically\nrefuted.\nThe rejoinder to this criticism comes in two steps. The first\nmove is to reduce all self -des truction to self -deception -- on\nthe supposition that as self -destruction hurts oneself, it is\nnever desirable and so it is never reasonably desired. (It is\nunnatural.) The second move is to reduce wickedness to self -\ndestruction. The way to effect this last reduction is to show\nthat the wicked are sawing the branch on which they sit. This is\nshown by the claim that, as their need for friends requires they\nshould be benevolent not wicked. This is unsatisfactory, as it\nmay work for friends, perhaps even for p otential friends too,\nbut not ever for enemies. It looks eminently reasonable to be\nvicious to them. Then different arguments are marshaled. An\nappeal is made to providence: It is in one's best interest to be\non good terms with divine powers. This, too, is unsatisfactory,\nas it is an appeal to the wishes of the divine, not to those of a\nself- reliant actor. The holders of the monopoly on divine\npowers always oppose self- reliance. An appeal may then be\nmade to one's need for peace of mind, and hence for peace\nwith one's conscience (he conclusion of Hume, 1980, explains\nmartyrdom this way). This, too, is unsatisfactory: Conscience is\nbased on religion, and the exercise of eudaimony was initially\nintended to do away with it, and for good reasons: Clearly, it is\nnot conscience, but the sense of guilt, that disturbs the peace\nof mind. This sense of guilt is forcibly established by religious\neducation to undermine self- reliance. All advocates of self-\nreliance recommend that the sense of guilt be eradicated\n(Kaufmann , 1973; Agassi &amp; Agassi, 1985).\nIt is still possible to defend the doctrine of eudaimony, or\nenlightened self- interest: Self -destructive action is prevented\nby the sufficiently clear understanding of its consequences. The\nstandard contemporary example is smoking, but any bad habit\nwill do. The victims of a bad habit know that their conduct is\nnot in their self- interest, but only in a vague manner: They\noften refuse to see it clearly until their physician convinces\nthem that they are killing themselves. Then many of these\npeople find themselves freed of their bad habit with no effort at\nall. Hence, the intensified energy and sense of guilt invested in\nefforts to stop a bad habit are forms of self -deception: What is\nneeded is not effort nor strong will, but clear understanding of\nthe harm it causes, say the sages of the Enlightenment.\nAs it happens, all this is neither here nor there. Whatever the\nrule is for right behavior, it is clear that self-deception is not\nthe right mode of conduct, yet it is prevale nt. Even the\nassumption that all wickedness is due to self-deception does\nnot help vindicate humanity very much, since self- deception is\nevidently wicked: The pure at heart will hardly fall for it.\n(Others are guilty of the sin of pride.) Hence, regardless of\nwhether one should be as fully self- reliant as possible, and\nwhether the canons of right conduct are those of enlightened\nself- interest, self-deception is both erroneous and sinful, yet it\nis regularly practiced. Why? In particular, is it the sin of it that\nbrings about the error, or is it the other way around?\nBefore we proceed, we may wish to know, what does it matter?\nImperfection is a familiar fact, as are both wickedness and\nstupidity. Why does the old party insist that all impropriety is\nsin, an d why does the new party insist that all sin is error? Why\nnot lump them together, or say that impropriety and\nmisconduct are at times due to error and at other times due to\nsin (and often due to both)? After all, criminal law says exactly\nthis: Criminal c ourts are often called to adjudicate and decide\nabout the reason for some misdeed - - is it due to sin or to\nerror? Moreover, such courts also distinguish between\npermissible and impermissible error. (This is the root difference\nbetween murder, premeditated or not, and involuntary\nmanslaughter or accidental killing.) Why insist on reducing\nerror to sin or the other way around?\nThe answer is this: Suppose that behind every sin lurks some\nerror. The way to reduce sin is then not by preaching, but by\nenlighte ning. This is the explanation that historically stood\nbehind the Enlightenment movement's optimistic view of\nhumanity: Sinfulness is allegedly a part of human nature,\nwhereas ignorance certainly is not. But this is questionable:\nJust as one may say that be hind every sin is error, one may\nalso say that behind every error is sin. Ignorance leads to\nexcusable error only, whereas the error of people's ways are\ndeviations from the straight and narrow. Established religion\ncomes to prevent sin, and it teaches the true doctrine, but\npeople who are wicked will not listen. Thus, according to all\nestablishments that issue rules of proper conduct, self-reliance\nis the cardinal sin. (Hence, science can have no such\nestablishment! This is conspicuously false, yet in the Age of\nReason, in the time when classical rationalism flourished, it\nwas much more reasonable than it is today to assume that\nscience has no establishment whatsoever.) Here, again, we\nmeet the source of the disagreement: It is this question --\nwhat is bett er to rely on, individual self- reliance or traditional\nwisdom?\nThis does not solve the problem at all. The fact remains that\nboth morality and science are cultivated. Why try to eliminate\none of these? The answer is that one depends on the other:\nWisdom, says established religion, begins with the purity of\nheart (&#34;the beginning of wisdom is the fear of God&#34;); ethics,\nretort the enlightened, begins with the intelligent employment\nof reason. Does this dispute matter? Should it not be ignored\nand both morality and reason be employed?\nAll this will still not do. This discussion is stuck with the\nproblematic phenomenon of self -deception; it is admittedly\nboth stupid and wicked; It is better eradicated, but no one\nknows how. Even the combined use of both expla ining and\npreaching does not overcome it, and so there is a genuine need\nto learn more about it so as to cure it. The two common\ntheories identify it as a sin as well as an error, yet they differ\nas to which one is the source of the other. Which is it then? In\nthe hope of finding a better cure, a better understanding of\nself-deception may be sought. In this search, attempts may be\nmade to criticize both theories.\nBacon's Doctrine of Prejudice\nThe present discussion has got into a loop as sin and error are\nreducible to one another: Even if all error/sin is sin/error, it\nseems that the very disposition to err/sin lies in our\nmoral/intellectual imperfection. All humans are disposed to\nboth sin and error, and it is hard to decide which of the two\ndispositions lies deeper. Moreover, as this discussion concerns\nself-deception, it is important to note possibly self -deception is\ninexplicable even were it known if error is the cause of sin or\nvice versa. The curious historical fact is that the presentation\nof the problem was first forcefully made by Sir Francis Bacon,\naround the year 1600. He solved it not by any attempt to\nchoose between blaming sin for error and blaming error for sin\nbut by blaming self-deception for both. He was not concerned\nwith the question, which comes first, sin or error? He was not\nconcerned with social and political philosophy. He had a\ntremendous vision: A great scientific revolution is in the offing,\nand it will bring about a great technological revolution. He was\nconvinced that most social and political problems would be\nsolved by the technological revolution. Until then, he\nrecommended, a conservative attitude to politics should\nprevail.\nAs Bacon was convinced that technology would be\nrevolutionized by the development of scientific knowle dge\nproper, his sole concern in most of his writings was to help the\nadvancement of learning (for a detailed discussion of all this,\nsee Agassi, 1988b). Bacon took for granted the ancient doctrine\nof how enlightenment comes about: The pure mind is prepared\nto perceive the truth in an intuitive experience of sorts. This\ndoctrine is generally known all over the world as mysticism\n(see Agassi, 1981b, Chapter 23). There is much confusion here:\nThe mystics proper do not claim that their knowledge is given\nto cle ar articulation, yet the Platonic and Aristotelian theories\nof learning do. Hence, these theories are not quite mystical;\nthe neo -Platonic or cabalistic doctrines are mystical. The\ncentral question that this raises is, how is the mind purified? It\nengaged Bacon as it engaged many others before and after\nhim. (Different mystics have offered different rituals for this\npurpose.) Everybody agrees, of course, that, to that end, the\nmind has to be of a righteous man -- free of error. The\nquestion remains, how is the mind of cleansed of its errors?\nBoth Plato and Aristotle recommended critical debate as the\nmeans to that end. (Aristotle called this method 'epagoge', and\nthis word was translated into 'induction'.) It is the method of\nquestioning that ends up with de finitions, said Aristotle, as\ninvented by the Pythagoreans and perfected by Socrates and\nPlato. Definitions are the foundations of science, Aristotle\nadded, and they constitute the source of all true knowledge.\nBacon agreed about all of this except for the ancient view of\nthe efficacy of critical debate.\nCritical debates, said Bacon, have gone on in universities for\ncenturies, yet to no avail: Each party sticks to its guns. The\nreason is simple: One can always ignore criticism, or dismiss it\nwith a wittic ism (&#34;this is an exception that proves the rule&#34;),\nor, if one is obliged to take account of it, one can make a new\nsubtle distinction, to make a small exception, or otherwise\nbelittle the worth of an argument.\nThis raises two central questions. First, is it always possible to\nbelittle criticism? Second, why should one do that? The answer\nto the first question is in the affirmative. It is a powerful part\nof logic, known today as the Duhem-Quine thesis. Exceptions\ncan always be classified in a different category. (To take a\ncommon example, the prejudiced who recommend the\ndiscrimination of any sort of people may admit that an instance\nof the sort in question is unjust; they will then place these\ncounterinstances in a separate class and cling to their prejudic e\nagainst the remaining members of the discriminated sort. For\nmore details about the Duhem-Quine thesis see Agassi, 1994.)\nThere are different attitudes to criticism. Duhem said science\nmust accept criticism only in small doses so as to maintain its\nco ntinuity. Why should science do that? Duhem did not explain,\nbut the truth is that he was defending the same medieval\nmethod that Bacon was attacking because he greatly respected\nthe same medieval thinkers Bacon despised. Bacon declared\nthem enemies of pro gress; Duhem declared their contributions\nessential to the history of science. Bacon denied the very\nexistence of mediaeval science; Duhem was its first great\nhistorian. More important, Bacon agreed with the ancient\nrevered philosophers that total scientif ic knowledge of the\nwhole universe is possible; Duhem did not. Bacon declared the\nneed for one and only one scientific revolution -- the one that\neradicates all prejudice and all error; Duhem advocated\ncontinuity and denied the possibility of scientific re volutions.\nBacon envisaged a tremendous explosion of science; Duhem\ntaught that science proceeds in small steps. Bacon ignored\nmathematics altogether and recommended for the mind free of\nprejudice to collect as many and diverse observations of simple\nfacts as possible, and to proceed slowly and carefully towards\nthe goal of total scientific knowledge; Duhem saw this as naive\nand insisted on the need to develop the mathematical\napparatus that is essential for scientific knowledge and fitting\nthe facts within it.\nHow is one to judge between these views? Probably most\npeople will reject both, at least because at least two scientific\nrevolutions have occurred, contrary to both. Bacon was too\nradical in his demand to clean the slate with no theory left and\nDuhe m was too conservative in his claim that science suffers no\nrevolution as each stage of it depends on a previous stage\n(Agassi, 1957, 1963, 1981b. See also the biography of Duhem,\nJaki, 1984).\nBacon was a Utopian visionary in the style of his time -- the\nearly 17th century. He based his vision on a new idea: He\nassumed that the rejection of all preconceived opinions and the\naccumulation of a vast collection of items of factual information\nwill lead rapidly to the full growth of theoretical science.\nFurthe r, he was deeply convinced that this growth will bring\nsalvation, and that salvation is around the corner because\neveryone is naturally disposed to contribute to the growth of\nknowledge (Bacon, 1994, Bk. I, Aphorisms 15 -18). Why, then,\nis salvation not here already? Because there is a small obstacle\nto it: The sins of laziness and pride. People offer conjectures\ninstead of working hard in the search for the truth, and then\nthey refuse to admit criticism as it puts them to shame. Thus,\nthe demand for the purity of mind includes the demand for\ndevotion and humility, caution and resistance to the temptation\nto conjecture. Once one has made a conjecture, one sees the\nworld as conforming to it, is then bound to endorse it as true,\nand is then trapped in it: It be comes a fixed feature of one's\nintellectual makeup. (This is corroborated by contemporary\ncognitive theory: One who endorses the theory that all is x, say\ncognitive psychologists, sees x everywhere; x can be atoms,\nlife, sex, selfishness, or anything else.)\nPrejudging matters instead of letting facts speak for\nthemselves, Bacon explained, is the acceptance of a bribe. His\nexplanation is subtle, and reminds one of what the Bible says\nof it (Exodus, 23:8): Bribery blinds the wise. That is, one says\nto onese lf that one is wise enough not to be blinded by the\nbribe, but to no avail. The very bribe, argued Bacon, is what\nblinds one to the truth, as it is the flattery to oneself. It is only\nself-deception that stands between humanity and salvation\nthrough science. People flatter themselves that they are\ncleverer and more knowledgeable than they are, thus getting\nblind to criticism. Moreover, the psychology of perception as\nfirst offered by Bacon, and as still taught today, suggests that\nnothing can be done about it. To become a good researcher,\nsaid Bacon, one must humbly admit ignorance, and relinquish\nall the preconceived notions that one happens to have; only\nthen, he said, will one qualify to seek knowledge, and even\nthen this holds as long as one does not pro nounce opinions.\nBacon's idea is generally rejected nowadays. It is generally\nagreed that people cannot live with empty heads. (Only some\ndevotees of popular cheap versions of Oriental mysticism\nendorse the false view that some techniques empty the head of\nall ideas.)\nThe observation that theory blinds one to facts that offer\ncriticism of it is a central part of contemporary psychology of\nperception and cognition. It often goes today by the name of\nthe 20th -century psychologist Leon Festinger. This observ ation\nhas led some thinkers, such as Giordano Bruno and Galileo\nGalilei of the 16th and 17th century, to the obvious conclusion\nthat such observations spuriously validate the theories that\ninvoke them. Bacon agreed but claimed that a theory can be\nproperly validated -- when it is rooted in unbiased\nobservations: As long as theory precedes observation, he said,\nits validation by facts is assured for all those who propound it\nand for no other; only if it emerges by itself out of many and\ndiverse observations, he assured his reader, is the result truly\nassured and will convince all. Hence, proper observation begins\nwith the cleaning of the observer's mind, and therefore\nobservers must be humble and attend to small facts, not aspire\nto be the proud originators o f great philosophical systems.\nWhy is the sin of pride so special in the scheme of things? Why\nare all sins to be viewed as errors, yet pride the sin at the root\nof error? Bacon answered that pride too is but error; of course\nit is a form of self -deception. It is the error that is the source\nof all errors, as it inhibits the natural disposition to learn the\ntruth; it perverts the natural order of things by placing theory\nprior to observation, like building a house beginning from the\nroof.\nBacon stressed that the matter is subtle. There was no known\nreason to forbid the making of conjectures before he discovered\nthat conjecture perverts the mind so that it is essential to\nrelinquish all preconceived notions before one can contribute to\nthe advancement of learning. Because the natural disposition to\ndevelop science is stronger than the disposition to make\nconjectures, Antiquity had knowledge and no reason to advance\nany conjecture. Then conjectures were advanced, especially\nthose of Aristotle, and they were wicked. Once knowledge was\nperverted, it could not be restored without Bacon's new cure --\nhis prescription of cleaning the slate and proceeding with\ncaution. Naturally until then self -deception was the rule.\nAccordingly, Bacon called his philosophy &#34;The Great\nInstauration&#34;, meaning the return to the golden age of\nAntiquity.\nA Short History of Self- Deception\nSelf- deception, to repeat, is ubiquitous, as is the folk literature\nabout it. Also, folk literature presents self -deception as self-\nflattery. This is a point that Bacon's doctrine makes central.\nBacon's proposal of a remedy had an old component and a new\none. The old component is the following advice: Do not be\ngullible, trust no one but the facts and your own reason. The\nnew component is; Discard all earlier opinions and start afresh.\nThis is Baconian radicalism, and this is what characterizes\nmodern, classical rationalist philosophy. Its most specific\ncharacteristic is its being Crusonian, as Popper and Gellner\nhave called it (Popper, 1945, vol. 2, pp. 219-20, 215; Gellner,\n1995, p. 7; see also Agassi, 1981b, pp. 477-85, 488). As\nDescartes found out, after cleaning one's slate and before\ndeveloping one's own philosophy, one is utterly alone. In the\n19th century Descartes' philosophy and his venture, the\nBaconian venture of starting afresh, were not as popular as in\nearlier centuries. One of its opponents was Kierkegaard (1985,\nPreface), who nevertheless admired Descartes for having the\ncourage needed for this venture. As this venture was deemed\ncentral to modern, classical rationalism, understandably,\nrejecting it led many, Kierkegaard included, to reject\nrationalism itself.\nThe reason that self -deception is the single obstacle, and such\na formidable one at that, is simple. Almost any obstacles that\nmay lie on the way of a self- reliant individual may be handled\nin the best manner available. The only insurmountable obstacle\nto self -reliance is self -deception, since its victims are unaware\nof its very presence. Classical rationalists deemed the Baconian\nventure of cleaning the slate indispensable because it is easy to\ndeceive oneself: As long as one holds to any opinion, to any\nopinion whatsoever, one is too well disposed toward it. Hence,\nthose who rejected Bacon's radicalism were disposed to the\nview that self -deception is unavoidable. After Bacon had\ngranted prominence and significance to the disposition for self -\ndeception as the chief obstacle to the advancement of learning,\nand so to advancement in general, it became clear that the\ndisposition to be rational depends on the single condition that\nself-deception be avoided. The irrationalists then centered, as\nthey still do, on this question: Can this single condition ever be\nmet? Irrationalism is the correct denial of the possibility of\navoiding all self- deception and the erroneous conclusion that it\nis better to rely on tradition, the leadership or one's gut -\nfeelings than on oneself.\n(Bacon's radicalism is not new: It is cabalistic in origin. Why\ndid the performance of the cabalistic ritual fail to bring\nsalvation? Because there is a catch here: To be valid, the ritual\nshould be perform by a deserving individual, and that individual\nmust be humble. But it is hard to be humble when one brings\nsalvation to the world. Why do people end up in hell if they\nmay repent even at the gates of hell? Because the wicked are\nhaughty, and, at the gate of hell, they deceive themselves that\nthey are there not deservedly, but out of good will - - out of the\nwill to save its inmates.)\nThe advocacy of self-reliance look as if it were identical to the\nadvocacy of rationality, and either looks as if it were identical\nto the advocacy of the avoidance of self- deception. The\nopposite of self-reliance is the reliance on others, who are not\nreliable, since there is nothing to rely o n except one's own\nreason. Hence, the reliance on others is being deceived and all\ndeception is self -deception at heart. According to Bacon, the\ntransition from reliance on others to self -reliance takes effort,\ncourage, and much good will. This is particularly so because,\nwe remember, according to Bacon, self -reliance begins with the\ncleaning of one's slate -- with starting afresh. This, as\nKierkegaard stressed, is rather frightening. It also leaves too\nmany questions unanswered, such as, what should one do in\nmatters pertaining to one's means of livelihood and of one's\nreligion? These questions were hardly ever dealt with.\nDescartes reported that he would not embark on the project of\ncleaning his slate before he had answered them to his own\nsatisfaction. To day, almost all students of this matter agree\nthat these questions were hardly ever dealt with, and they can\nnever be satisfactorily answered.\nThis is a significant point. Children have faith in a Santa Claus\nof one sort or another, and in their having m others. Somehow\nthe faith in Santa Claus fades away, but having mothers is\nnever questioned. (Feminists have a point, then, when they say\nthere could never have been a female Descartes.) The demand\nthat one should doubt even the existence of one's body, then,\nis only understandable in the sense that the extant scientific\ntheories of bodies should be doubted. Indeed, the idealists who\ndenied the existence of matter did not question the\ncommonsense view of matter and of their own having emerged\nout of their mothers' wombs. They questioned the theory of\nmatter propounded by Descartes, by Newton, or by other\nphysicists. It is no accident that the Baconian program and its\nexecution by Descartes concerned the improvement of the\nnatural sciences and technologies, hardly the improvement of\nthe social sciences (or the moral sciences, to use the\nantiquated terminology), and even less so the social and\npolitical technologies. The application of the Baconian program\nto social and political studies came later, as an afterthought,\nand its application to political affairs was unexpected and\nbizarre.\nThe Baconian project -- his plan to develop science - - was a\ngreat success, as was his idea that technology will develop\nmagnificently on scientific foundations. His view was e choed by\nhis followers John Locke, David Hume, and, above all, Adam\nSmith (Hal\xe9vy, 1955, p. 433). During the French Revolution it\nwas echoed by Condorcet (1976; see also Schapiro, 1934). It\nwas the faith that scientific -technological progress will\ninevitably improve social matters without much ado. This\nBaconian aspiration -- to save humanity through the\nadvancement of science and technology -- failed totally,\nalthough not before it landed humanity in the modern world --\nindustrial, post-industrial, and developing -- for better or\nworse.\nThe first great fiasco of the Baconian program to save humanity\nthrough the advancement of science and technology was the\nFrench Revolution. The idea is not new that the revolution was\nthe daughter of the ideas of the Enlightenment movement,\nespecially its radicalism. This idea was advanced by the leading\nReactionary thinkers, Edmund Burke and Georg Wilhelm\nFriedrich Hegel (see Agassi, 1977, pp. 218 -20). They did not\nsay it out right, but their followers did: People want to b e\ndeceived. They want that because they cannot practice self -\nreliance. This Reactionary idea helped the tyrants of the\nmodern, developed world immensely, and caused untold harm.\nThe Reaction had much less of a vision and no program, yet\nbeing conservative it could always fall back on tradition. The\ncentral idea of the Reaction, then, was that people need\ntradition to tell them what to believe in. This takes the central\nidea of the Reaction out of the present discourse. The Reaction\nmade a concession to the Enlightenment movement: Some\nindividuals can be self -reliant. They prove it by going into the\ndesert and staying there without food, drink, or company for\nforty days and forty nights. The Reaction deprived even the few\nself- reliant individuals of their reason: They are exceptional\nbecause they are extremely ambitious, and they follow their\nown bent no matter what. This is a recommendation for self-\ndeception on a grand scale. It suggests that the exceptional\nmust be lonely and stubborn, which is what cha racterizes many\npsychopathological cases. Indeed, Hegel said there is no way to\ndistinguish between the exceptional who is a genius from the\none who is crazy, or alienated, to use the term of Pinel: To be\njudged alienated (by accepted norms) is the price for one's\ndecision to be self -reliant (until one manages to alter the\nnorms and then be declared a hero). The Reactionary doctrine\nof dependence and self - reliance is a gross exaggeration. Let us\nreturn to a more commonsensical version of rationalism\n(Agassi, 1981b, Chapter 15.)\nExtreme Rationalism as Self- Deception\nNo rule of logic is more potent than that which proscribes\ncontradictions: They are deadly. Not only are they\ndemonstrably false; declaring one true is the denial of all error,\nand so it is the admission of every possible statement.\nNevertheless, a mathematical text can all too easily include\none. In mathematics a misprint may introduce an error, and\nintroducing an error into a mathematical system usually\namounts to adding a contradiction to it (the equation 1 + 2 = 3\nbecomes a contradiction when any one item in it is misprinted).\nStrictly, the rule banning all contradictions renders all texts\nthat contain such misprints worthless. However, it is often easy\nto eliminate misprints by simply overlooking them, and this is\ndone heedlessly unless and until they cause trouble. Even\nresearchers whose ideas seem inconsistent are known to\nproceed working without worry about inconsistency, in the hope\nthat this matter will be taken care of later. It is hard to judge\nhow rational this attitude is; in the oversight of inconsistency,\none risks the waste of time in the study of a worthless system.\nIf the system under study happens to be consistent, or if the\ninconsistency in it is easy to remove, the result of the study\nmay be useful. However, often a researcher investing much\nefforts in some interesting question will obtain exciting results\nthat rest on an inconsistency, so that the invested labor was\nsheer waste.\nHere is an interesting corollary to the theory of self-deception.\nIt is one thing to take a calculated risk, regardless of whether\nthe end result is happy. It is quite another thing to pretend to\nhave taken a calculated risk, be optimistic about matters, and\nforge ahead carelessly. Often the investment o f effort is only of\nsome pleasant hours of research that one may easily afford to\nlose. It is an observed fact that if stakes are high and the\nresearcher is highly strung, self -deception steps in as the\nrefusal to entertain the merest possibility of an error. It is hard\nto differentiate the reasonable cases of calculated risk from the\ncases of carelessness, as there is no theory that tells us when\nthe risk is great and when not. Perhaps there can be no such\ntheory regarding research.\nSo much for the requirement for consistency. It is more\ndifficult to study other requirements, as these may be\nabandoned. This is the case with demonstrability - - the super-\ncriterion traditionally most generally adhered to and rightly\nmost respected. It is invalid; adherence to it causes confusion\nand self -deception. Without the assumption that philosophers\naddicted to it are deluding themselves, it is hard to explain its\npopularity, despite its great allure. Historically, it is a central\nidea, and yet today it is recognized as most baffling. What is\ndemonstrability? What theory of it is there? As its natural place\nis in mathematics, it can be examined there first.\nThe standard examples of demonstrations -- of proofs -- are\nmathematical, especially those of Euclid and of Archimedes. By\nmodern standards, the quality of these demonstrations is very\nlow. Russell (1917, pp. 66, 94-50) said that Euclid's proofs\nscarcely qualify. The first to have offered reasonable proofs,\nsaid Russell, was George Boole, at the mid -19th century (p.\n74). In classical geometry, proofs consisted of deductions from\nthe axioms of geometry. What follows from a theorem is a\ntheorem, yet two nagging questions remained unanswered.\nFirst, what makes the axioms theorems? Answer: Axioms are\nself-evident: it is impossible to question their truth. Yet at\nleast one axiom of Euclid was always questioned (for each\nstraight line no more than one parallel line goes through a\ngiven point). In the 19th century, a system of geometry was\nconstructed in which that axiom was relinquished. Early in the\n20th century, Einstein developed a theory of gravity whose\ngeometry is non-Euclidean. (It denies that space is the same\neverywhere, as it assumes that the properties of space differ\nwhere gravity differs.) So much for the self-ev idence of axioms.\nThe other question is, how is proof possible without axioms? It\nhas to do with the theorems in the fields of arithmetic and of\nalgebra. These were not based on axioms until early in the 20th\ncentury.\nSo much for proofs. As to proof theo ry, it was developed in the\n1930s by combined efforts of a few great logicians. Their work\nwas clouded by confusions, most of which were cleared decades\nlater. Perhaps even now, proof theory is too problematic, so\nthat perhaps we are still not entitled to claim possession of a\nclear proof theory, not even in logic and mathematics.\nYet the puzzling fact is that classical rationalist philosophy\nrested on the idea that rationality equals proof. An example of\nthe magnitude of the puzzlement may be useful, especially as it\nprovides the flavor of the feeling that accompanies the\nsituation. The classical and most popular work of Wittgenstein\n(1922, Preface and famous last sentence) is accompanied by an\nair of tremendous tension: It declares that, on the one hand,\nwhat it says is so obvious that its articulation is neither\npossible nor called for, and on the other hand it is so difficult\nthat it is beyond words. Much controversy rages as to how to\nread his text, and much of it revolves around the question of\nproof and provability, and of what exactly the message about it\nis. Possibly, however, the literature in question is a mere\nexpression of a tremendous sense of frustration at the inability\nof commentators to face their own inability to prove, which is\nto say tha t the literature in question is a mere exercise in the\nfutility of self-deception.\nAs proof theory developed, it was proved that all effective\nproof procedures are limited, even in mathematics, let alone\nelsewhere, were proof elsewhere at all possible. T he proof --\nG\xf6del's celebrated proof -- was rejected by Wittgenstein. In the\nmeantime, the matter has developed much further, and proof\nprocedures and their limitations have become a field of\nintensive study within computer science. What is not provable\nin one system may be provable in another, as it can be added\nas an axiom; but their addition will create other unprovable\ntheorems. Contrary to Wittgenstein, there is no comprehensive\nsystem in which the logical status of all that can be said is\ndecided once and for all.\nThe idea that rationality equals proof is most basic. It is the\nsource of much strength, but also of much self-deception --\nwithin philosophy as well as within science. Bacon,\nWittgenstein, and many others said, when in doubt one should\nrefrain from endorsing any opinion, one should suspend\njudgment, and one should never express any opinion about\nwhat is doubtful, particularly not in public. Otherwise, self-\ndeception is inevitable. This idea, hostile to self-deception as it\nis, looks immune to it. The fear that it is itself the malady it\ncomes to cure is as frightening as the idea that physicians\ncause death. The fear that the medicine is worse than the ills it\ncomes to cure produces a feeling of helplessness, and that\nfeeling is a tremendous incentive for self -deception. Indeed,\nthis is what happened when Semmelweis brought crucial\nempirical evidence to support the claim that physicians kill\npatients by not washing their hands. For decades his view and\nhis prescription were rejected by his peers. This is a clear case\nof a dangerous, irresponsible, grand -scale self-deception,\npracticed by a scientifically oriented group.\nHowever erroneous classical rationalism is, it is still very\npopular among philosophers who like it for its advocacy of the\nuse of reason and its support of science and of self -reliance.\nYet it is itself a case of self-deception. These days, the rule of\nscience is tacitly identified as the acceptance of the expert's\nauthority. This is very disconcerting, as any acceptance of any\nauthority is, as it conflicts with the demand for self- reliance. It\nis also silly. It is well known that the acceptance of the expert's\nauthority may be fatal (see last paragraph for an example). The\nstandard answer to this trite observation is that the reliance on\nexperts is unavoidable in the modern world. Even it were\nunavoidable, this does not make it less fatal. Moreover, the\nunavoidability of the reliance on experts has nothing particular\nto do with the modern world: It has always been the case, an d\nit is much less so today, when the educated citizen knows more\nmedicine than the best physician of a century ago. As the\nhypothesis that there is no choice but to rely on experts is\nrefuted, it may be replaced with increasingly better hypotheses\nthat wil l say how far and under which conditions the reliance on\nthe experts' authority is worse than doing altogether without\nthem. The reliance on experts' authority is clearly the worst\nsuperstition of the allegedly rationalist and the allegedly\nscientifically inclined, and this includes most research scientists\naround (Feyerabend, 1970).\nSelf- Deception as Fixation\nBacon's doctrine of prejudice was limited to the prejudices of\nthe researchers. Marx extended it to the views -- the prejudices\n-- extant in the gene ral population, especially the extant\nphilosophy of life. He labeled it 'ideology'. Following Hegel he\ndenied the universalism of the Enlightenment movement, and\nreplaced it with the view that the parochial views are locally\nvalid. (Hegel called the views and attitudes agreeable to the\nstate 'the Universal'.) This theory is known as relativism or,\nmore specifically, epistemic and moral relativism (see Agassi,\n1992). Every period of history, Hegel said, has its own truths,\nas created by the heroes who are the leading lights of that\nperiod. These heroes together constitute the group of\nindividuals who count -- &#34;the World Historical Figures.&#34; Marx\naccepted Hegel's epistemic and moral relativism only for the\npast -- for class society. He declared the truth in a class\nsociety to be socially determined, but he taught that, in\nclassless society, the truly universal would prevail. Hence, in a\nclass society all truths are relative and socially determined.\nHence, all ideology is class prejudice. Being prejudices,\nideologies are hard to shake off. This can only be done by\nindividuals who can peer into the mechanisms of history, like\nMarx himself -- they can divine the future society and the\ntruths of that society.\nAccording to Marx the society of his day was ruled by\nemployers, by the capitalists. He predicted that the ruling class\nof his day were destined to be replaced by employees, by the\nworkers. He viewed other philosophers as captives of capitalist\nprejudices. He viewed himself as the mouthpiece of the future\nsociety. He viewed the prejudices of the capitalists inferior to\nthose of the workers. He therefore held the view that the views\nhe was holding were superior to those held by other\nphilosophers.\nThis is Hegelian: The top representative of humanity, be it the\ntop nation (Hegel), top class (Marx), top civilization or culture\n(Spengler, Toynbee), or anything else that is tops, is tops in\neach and every respect. Hegel had a simple justification for this\nbizarre idea: The best is the militarily strongest, and the\nstrongest takes all that is of value -- the way Napoleon robbed\nthe countries he conquered of their artwork. Hegel and Marx\nnever explained why the arts and sciences always progress and\nthey disregarded the historical facts of regress. The most\nconspicuous fact that Greek art and science are superior to\nmediaeval art and science was brushed aside with the aid of\nthe claim for the superiority of the mediaeval political system\nor its agricultural technology over its predecessors. This is only\nevidence that being superior in one dimension is no guarantee\nfor superiority in another. This option did not occur to Marx nor\nto Marxist scholars in the middle of the 20th century. (The\nfamous scientist and historian of science J. D. Bernal (1939,\nChapter 2, Section 1) declared flippantly that medieval science\nis superior to Greek science. (See also Bernal, 1952, 1954, p.\n209; Agassi, 1963, Chapter 7 and notes.)\nTraditionally, philosophy was reductionist: It recommended that\nevents that belong to the different human sc iences should be\nexplained by theories from only one human science. Traditional\nreduction was to psychology: All human science, it was\nsuggested, are at heart psychology: Sociology, politics and\neconomics are really parts of psychology. Bacon's doctrine of\nprejudice was perhaps behind this trend. When Hegel reduced\nthe individual to society and declared political history the basic\nhuman science, he declared it essential for sanity to believe in\nnational myths. Marx advocated the reduction of all human\nsciences to economics. He wanted to see all explanation of\nhuman affairs by reference to the economic conditions of the\nsociety in which they occur, chiefly in terms of the\nadvancement of its technology. Freud, however, clung to the\ntraditional recommendation to reduce all human phenomena to\npsychology. He attempted to explain the way some private\nprejudices have a strong hold on the minds of their victims: He\nwas impressed by the fact that neuroses constitute intellectual\nblind spots, especially when the neurotics who sustain them are\nintelligent. He explained this by his theory of the emotional\ntrauma ('trauma' means wound).\nFreud's theory of the emotional trauma is simple. The cause of\nevery neurosis, he suggested, is a trauma caused by some\nfrightening, painful childhood event. Initially, the trauma leads\nto an attempt to cope with it by conjecturing a hypothesis.\nBeing infantile, this hypothesis is not surprisingly of a low\nintellectual level. What is surprising is that the neurotic never\ngets over the init ial hypothesis. This, Freud explained, is due to\ntwo facts. First, reliving the traumatic incident is painful.\nSecond, one attempts to avoid that pain. For example, if one\nconjectures that the pain in question is caused by the rejection\ndue to one's lack o f achievement, one will increase one's\nefforts to achieve. The refutation of the hypothesis will only\nlead to redoubling the effort, rather than to recognizing that no\neffort will reverse the rejection (because one tries to achieve\nthe wrong object, becaus e the rejection is irreversible, because\nthere was no rejection to begin with, or because of anything\nelse). Therefore, the purpose of psychoanalytic treatment\nshould be liberating neurotics from the prejudices that are at\nthe base of their neurotic conduct, which incapacitates them.\nThis, according to Freud, can be achieved only by helping them\nrelive their initial traumatic experiences. Once this is achieved,\npatients experience strong relief and a sense of catharsis, and\nthen, according to Freud, all is well.\nThis is Freud's celebrated catharsis theory. He later claimed to\nhave refuted it to his own satisfaction. It is difficult to say what\nreplaced catharsis as the aim of psychoanalytic treatment after\nthat theory was abandoned. Possibly Freud was too hasty to\nreject the theory; Possibly the fault was not in the ascription of\ntherapeutic power to catharsis, but in the view that, after it,\nthe patient is well and the treatment is over. I (Agassi, 1981a)\nhave suggested that the recovered mental patient ne eds\ntreatment that is usually accorded to the physically\nconvalescent. When a convalescent has weak muscles, it\nmatters little why; the question is, how should they be\nstrengthened? The same may be true of the mentally\nconvalescent, whose decision power is small. If so, what\nprecisely the prejudice was that the catharsis reveals is less\nimportant than the treatment accorded to willing mentally\nconvalescents. This shows that Freud's theory is one of self -\ndeception. It is a model for a number of such theories , yet not\na sufficiently good one, as it does not take into account the\natrophy of self -reliance due to prolonged neurosis. Freud has\nrightly observed that adolescents often get rid of their\nprejudices, but not those acquired under severe traumas --\ninclud ing morality, which is thus inculcated under the\nconditions of brainwashing, said Feyerabend (1968).\nSelf- deception can be treated in all generality. It is rational to\ninquire, to seek the truth, but perhaps not at any cost. At\ntimes, the search for the truth is too costly, and its outcome is\nof little significance. In these cases, it is reasonable to give up\nthe quest. This is a troublesome catch. One remains ignorant,\nfirst, of the truth that one allows to remain hidden, and then\nalso of the cost of giv ing it up - - of relinquishing it. More than\nBacon, Freud renders self -deception as the opposite of the\nsearch for the truth. He insisted more on the relentless search\nfor the truth. Yet the limitation on the cost of the search for\nthe truth remains. Select iveness is unavoidable, and one about\nthe search for the truth is inherently blind. What should be\ndone about this? Freud was troubled by interminable analysis,\nwhich is an expression of both the excessive cost of analysis\nand its contribution to the increased atrophy of the patient's\nself- reliance.\nThis is where Freud got stuck. Bacon's doctrine relates to the\nsearch for the scientific truth. He said the search should not be\nselective, because any selection is guided by an idea, and that\nidea is a prejud ice: It is judgment prior to the presentation of\nthe relevant evidence. Even asking specific question, Bacon\nsaid, is selective. The choice of a question is rooted in a\nprejudice. To avoid prejudice, research must be indiscriminate\nand all discovery accide ntal. Freud's view of his own research\nwas orthodox Baconian; his claim that his theory evolved out of\nmyriads of observations was clearly Baconian; his suggestion\nthat analysts intervene minimally in the analytic process of\nself-discovery was based on his fear of prejudice. Yet his\ntheory was related to everyday life, where the question about\nthe search for the truth cannot be as all encompassing as in\nresearch. Thus, he could not say how neuroses-free the\naverage citizen should be (Freud, 1962, third para graph from\nthe end).\nFreud appealed to simple common sense: One often deviates\nfrom the normal healthy views of things, and one is then\nnormally corrected by circumstances or by peers. It is abnormal\nto resist this kind of correction. Abnormal resistance to\ncommon sense is at times intelligent, as in the case of a\nresearch scientist. Alternatively, it is sometimes unintelligent,\nat other times it is hardly a trouble, and still other times it\nincapacitates. This then requires treatment. Here then is the\nplace for Freud's original contribution: The neurotic resistance\nis still rational, although it is obsessive (i.e., pathological). It\nis the insistence of avoiding the pain of reliving the trauma.\nThis is a hurdle the incapacitated should be helped to clear.\nReluctance to discuss one's opinions rationally is the outcome\nof the assessment that discussion will be painful. However, one\nis never able to assess properly the cost of the reluctance to\nacquire information for want of that very information. Therefore\none should always be ready to reassess one's view that the\npain is not worth the benefit. If common sense calls for this\nreassessment and is met with an obsessive refusal, perhaps the\ncause is psychopathological. Otherwise, the resistance is better\ndiagnosed differently, especially when it expresses the fear of\nself- reliance ('decidophobia' is the apt term offered by\nKaufmann, 1973).\nConclusion: The New Theory of Rationality\nThe discussion thus far is couched within common sense or in a\nframework that diffe rs radically from the classical theory of\nrationality. Since Freud fully endorsed that theory, his\ndiscussion was possibly inconsistent -- in that it mixed common\nsense with the classical theory of rationality. Even if it is\nconsistent, it is encumbered with irrelevant difficulties, and in\nits original wording it is much harder to comprehend than its\n(more general) variant reproduced here.\nThe discussion herein also deviates from the classical theory of\nrationality in its avoidance of the theory that the rational is the\nprovable. Nor does it require an explicit wording of an\nalternative theory of rationality. The new theory of rationality\nthat is required should share with common sense the idea that\nthere is no human perfection. It should not assume any pa rt or\naspect of any product of the human mind to be perfect and\nabove error. Briefly, it should include the idea that it is\ndesirable to eliminate error as far as possible; it suggests that\nthis is done by criticism. Criticism, then, should be viewed not\nas hostile, but as help. This idea is not new, and is clearly\nexpressed in Plato's Gorgias. Yet in the writings of Plato (and\nAristotle) the rationality of criticism is presented as a mere\npreliminary to the rationality of proof. Omitting this, we receive\nthe new theory of rationality, or a variant of it: Critical\ndiscussion is not the appetizer but the main course. Hence, it is\nnot just concerning received opinions, as Plato and Aristotle\nsuggested, but an endless process of inventing ever newer\nconjectures and their refutations -- as much as is within the\npowers of the participants in the process Popper, 1945,\n[Agassi, 1995). (This raises the question, is logic perfect, and\nis mathematics? These matters are not discussed here,\nalthough they are of great philosophical interest.)\nThe assumption that criticism is rational is very rational, and\nits rejection by Bacon and his followers is a great pity,\nalthough Bacon was right to observe that critical discussion as\npracticed in the universities was an exercise in futility. The first\nmodern variant of the fallibilist theory of rationality, which\nincorporates the assumption that rationality is critical debate,\nis due to Popper (1945, Chapter 24). His theory is not free of\nobjections, especially Bacon's. Criticism may be pointless at\ntimes. It can also be an unaffordable luxury. It is impossible to\nknow if this applies to the case at hand. The theory under\nconsideration may deserve criticism and it may not: Investing\nin criticism risks wasting valuable time.\nExamp les of irrational critical thinking abound, and at times\nthey can be classified as pathological. Psychotherapists are\nfamiliar with many kinds of them. Patients are often ingenious\nat inventing new excuses that allow them to ignore or belittle\ncriticism of their views and conduct. Patients are likewise\ningenious at inventing criticisms of, and in finding lacunae in,\nthe assumptions behind threatening proposals of therapists.\nPeople often use many tools -- physical or mental -- without\nbothering about their inner mechanisms. When patients are\nafraid of using a proposal made by their therapists, they\nsuddenly show passionate interest in the mechanisms involved\nin the proposal and in critical debates about them. These\npassionate interests are delay tactics and expressions of fear.\nThe observation of Konrad Lorenz is relevant here: Conduct\nunder fear and pressure is less intelligent than the average in\nall animals. The claim made here is that even losing one's mind\nis a process due to rational conduct, but in fea r and under\ngreat stress, and so with an ever-decreasing level of rationality\n(Fried &amp; Agassi, 1976).\nThus, there are levels of rationality; the highest level available\nis hardly ever attained. It is approached only in some very\nleisurely, research -oriented discussions. Even then it is not\nalways clear what avenue is best to take (contrary to classical\nrationalism), as there are many possibilities, some of them\ninherently blind. Thus, it is only seldom clear how the level of\nrationality can be raised. Tha t the rationality of action may be\na matter of degree is common sense, and if all rationality\nshould be seen as a matter of degree, it is useful to view\nrational thought as a variant of rational action. Traditionally,\nrational thought, or rational opinion, was distinguished from\nrational action (including thinking). This is reinforced by the\ntraditional distinction between states (of mind) and (mental)\nprocesses. This distinction is subtle and redundant: Jarvie and I\n(Agassi &amp; Jarvie, 1987) have suggested to v iew thought as a\nkind of action and the theory of rational thought as a part of\nthe theory of rational action. This is meat to be a supplement\nto Popper's theory of rationality.\nThere are two points to mention before bringing this chapter to\na close. First, unlike the classical theory of rationality, the\nfallibilist theory does not split rationality sharply to the\nscientific and the rest. It also recognizes common sense and its\nprogress. (Think of the views of nutrition common a century\nago, which reco mmended what is today viewed as empty\ncalories and/or a cholesterol-rich diet; or of sexuality, which\ndeemed masturbation self-destructive and the pleasure of sex\nundesired by decent women.) It also takes for granted that, in\nscience as elsewhere, every significant criticism is an\ninvention, so that it is important to see the difficulty of being\ncritical (and so of being highly rational). This relates to the\nsecond point. The fear of criticism is rational, but not as\nrational as the effort to overcome it. Self-deception is thus a\nform of rational human conduct, but it is inferior to attempts to\novercome fear and more so to fearless openness. This is not to\nsay that every possible case of self -deception is equally\nharmful and to be equally harshly combated. O ften\npsychotherapists encounter cases that they judge -- hopefully\nrightly - - as not deserving treatment. The cases that do\ndeserve treatment, even at a great cost, Freud noted, are those\nthat grossly interfere with the ordinary course of life. Some\ncases are subtle and difficult to judge. A sense of proportion\nmust prevail in discussing them. The pursuit of the truth is\nlaudable, but it is not necessarily always the required\ntreatment.\nA sense of proportion is indispensable anyway, since there is no\ngreater self -deception than the claim that one is utterly free of\nit, as is regrettably exemplified by the great thinkers Bacon,\nMarx, and Freud. This should be remembered as a warning\nagainst excessive self -confidence: Humans are all fallible and,\nas Plato already observed in great detail, it behooves us to be\ngrateful for any attempt at criticism and correction.\nAppendix\nThe editor has drawn my attention to a very recent essay by\nAlfred R. Mele (Mele, 1996), that deserves notice because it\ncomprises a very comprehensive survey of the most recent\nliterature on self-deception, which is becoming increasingly\nfashionable these days. The literature is written from the\nviewpoint of the theory of rationality as the rational degree of\nbelief and that as the degree to which the belief is justified by\nexperience. This viewpoint was declared in this chapter as a\nversion of self-deception, perhaps also an expression of some\nanxiety. The starting -pint of that literature is the so-called\nparadox of self -deception. Assume that successful deception\noccurs when one who thinks that some statement is true\nconvinces someone else that it is not. Assume further that one\nsuccessfully deceives oneself the same way. As a result, one\ndoes and does not think that the statement in question is true.\nAs was explained here, it is easier to begin with self -deception\nand view most cases of deception as variants of it. As explained\nin this chapter, self-deception is always a form of ambiguity\nand/or confusion and ignorance, so that it is a spectrum, and\nthere is no sharp division between those engaged in it and\nthose who keep clear of it, although some people are very near\nthe one end of the spectrum and others on the other.\nMele reports numerous experiments in self -deception, with no\nregard to th e question, how well trained the subjects of the\nexperiment are in the art of self -criticism. The absence of self-\ncriticism, it was argued in this chapter, is not the same as self-\ndeception, especially since all criticism is the result of some\ncreative act . There is also the question of the cost of self -\ncriticism that the experiments discussed by Mele disregard. The\nexperimenters do not ask, how important is the self-deception\nunder discussion and how important the individuals in question\nconsiders it. Most engagement in astrology by modern educated\npeople is a mild, harmless form of self -deception that cannot\nbe taken as seriously as the case of self -deception that leads to\ndisaster.\nReferences\nAgassi, J.

{'abstract': u"Self- Deception in General &#34;A Liberal Decalogue&#34; suggests (Russell, 1967, pp. 60-61) not to envy people who live in a fool's paradise: It is a place only for fools. This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

{'abstract': u'Karl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason. Later on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and even called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to his annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

{'abstract': u"The variety of languages in the world is considered a curse by some, who view the phenomenon as a Tower of Babel. Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

It vividly describes one person interfering with the personality make-up of another, removing the other's ideology and replacing it, and similarly tampering with the other's tastes, pool of information to rely upon and whatever else goes into the make-up of the other's personality. Clearly, in some sense or another everyone interferes with the personality of people with whom they interact; yet what is meant here is something much more drastic than friends influencing one another's tastes or opinions; it is something more dramatic and more large scale.",

{'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

 {'abstract': u"The word &#34;brain-washing&#34;, translated from Chinese communist jargon, is a very strong metaphor, first popularized by Robert Jay Lifto n. It vividly describes one person interfering with the personality make-up of another, removing the other's ideology and replacing it, and similarly tampering with the other's tastes, pool of information to rely upon and whatever else goes into the make-up of the other's personality. Clearly, in some sense or another everyone interferes with the personality of people with whom they interact; yet what is meant here is something much more drastic than friends influencing one another's tastes or opinions; it is something more dramatic and more large scale.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

It vividly describes one person interfering with the personality make-up of another, removing the other's ideology and replacing it, and similarly tampering with the other's tastes, pool of information to rely upon and whatever else goes into the make-up of the other's personality. Clearly, in some sense or another everyone interferes with the personality of people with whom they interact; yet what is meant here is something much more drastic than friends influencing one another's tastes or opinions; it is something more dramatic and more large scale.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

 {'abstract': u"Self- Deception in General &#34;A Liberal Decalogue&#34; suggests (Russell, 1967, pp. 60-61) not to envy people who live in a fool's paradise: It is a place only for fools. This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason. Later on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and even called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to his annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

 {'abstract': u"Self- Deception in General &#34;A Liberal Decalogue&#34; suggests (Russell, 1967, pp. 60-61) not to envy people who live in a fool's paradise: It is a place only for fools. This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason. Later on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and even called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to his annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

Clearly, in some sense or another everyone interferes with the personality of people with whom they interact; yet what is meant here is something much more drastic than friends influencing one another's tastes or opinions; it is something more dramatic and more large scale.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

 {'abstract': u"Self- Deception in General &#34;A Liberal Decalogue&#34; suggests (Russell, 1967, pp. 60-61) not to envy people who live in a fool's paradise: It is a place only for fools. This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason.

All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others.

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

 {'abstract': u"The word &#34;brain-washing&#34;, translated from Chinese communist jargon, is a very strong metaphor, first popularized by Robert Jay Lifto n. It vividly describes one person interfering with the personality make-up of another, removing the other's ideology and replacing it, and similarly tampering with the other's tastes, pool of information to rely upon and whatever else goes into the make-up of the other's personality. Clearly, in some sense or another everyone interferes with the personality of people with whom they interact; yet what is meant here is something much more drastic than friends influencing one another's tastes or opinions; it is something more dramatic and more large scale.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

Later on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and even called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to his annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

 {'abstract': u"The variety of languages in the world is considered a curse by some, who view the phenomenon as a Tower of Babel. Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

It vividly describes one person interfering with the personality make-up of another, removing the other's ideology and replacing it, and similarly tampering with the other's tastes, pool of information to rely upon and whatever else goes into the make-up of the other's personality. Clearly, in some sense or another everyone interferes with the personality of people with whom they interact; yet what is meant here is something much more drastic than friends influencing one another's tastes or opinions; it is something more dramatic and more large scale.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

 {'abstract': u"Self- Deception in General &#34;A Liberal Decalogue&#34; suggests (Russell, 1967, pp. 60-61) not to envy people who live in a fool's paradise: It is a place only for fools. This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason. Later on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and even called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to his annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

Clearly, in some sense or another everyone interferes with the personality of people with whom they interact; yet what is meant here is something much more drastic than friends influencing one another's tastes or opinions; it is something more dramatic and more large scale.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

 {'abstract': u"Self- Deception in General &#34;A Liberal Decalogue&#34; suggests (Russell, 1967, pp. 60-61) not to envy people who live in a fool's paradise: It is a place only for fools. This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason. Later on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and even called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to his annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

 {'abstract': u"The variety of languages in the world is considered a curse by some, who view the phenomenon as a Tower of Babel. Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

 {'abstract': u"The word &#34;brain-washing&#34;, translated from Chinese communist jargon, is a very strong metaphor, first popularized by Robert Jay Lifto n. It vividly describes one person interfering with the personality make-up of another, removing the other's ideology and replacing it, and similarly tampering with the other's tastes, pool of information to rely upon and whatever else goes into the make-up of the other's personality. Clearly, in some sense or another everyone interferes with the personality of people with whom they interact; yet what is meant here is something much more drastic than friends influencing one another's tastes or opinions; it is something more dramatic and more large scale.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

 {'abstract': u"Self- Deception in General &#34;A Liberal Decalogue&#34; suggests (Russell, 1967, pp. 60-61) not to envy people who live in a fool's paradise: It is a place only for fools. This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason. Later on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and even called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to his annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason. Later on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and even called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to his annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

 {'abstract': u"The variety of languages in the world is considered a curse by some, who view the phenomenon as a Tower of Babel. Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

 {'abstract': u"The word &#34;brain-washing&#34;, translated from Chinese communist jargon, is a very strong metaphor, first popularized by Robert Jay Lifto n. It vividly describes one person interfering with the personality make-up of another, removing the other's ideology and replacing it, and similarly tampering with the other's tastes, pool of information to rely upon and whatever else goes into the make-up of the other's personality. Clearly, in some sense or another everyone interferes with the personality of people with whom they interact; yet what is meant here is something much more drastic than friends influencing one another's tastes or opinions; it is something more dramatic and more large scale.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason. Later on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and even called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to his annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

It vividly describes one person interfering with the personality make-up of another, removing the other's ideology and replacing it, and similarly tampering with the other's tastes, pool of information to rely upon and whatever else goes into the make-up of the other's personality. Clearly, in some sense or another everyone interferes with the personality of people with whom they interact; yet what is meant here is something much more drastic than friends influencing one another's tastes or opinions; it is something more dramatic and more large scale.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

 {'abstract': u"Self- Deception in General &#34;A Liberal Decalogue&#34; suggests (Russell, 1967, pp. 60-61) not to envy people who live in a fool's paradise: It is a place only for fools. This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason. Later on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and even called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to his annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

 {'abstract': u"Self- Deception in General &#34;A Liberal Decalogue&#34; suggests (Russell, 1967, pp. 60-61) not to envy people who live in a fool's paradise: It is a place only for fools. This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason. Later on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and even called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to his annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

({'abstract': u'Karl R. Popper is \u201cthe outstanding philosopher of the twentieth century\u201d (Bryan Magee), even \u201cthe greatest thinker of the [twentieth] century\u201d (Gellner). He felt affinity with thinkers of the Age of Reason and developed a new version of rationalism: critical rationalism. As a champion of science and of democracy he was the most influential philosopher of the post-WWII era. He was a close follower of Bertrand Russell and of Albert Einstein in that all three advocated problem-oriented fallibilism (during the peak of the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein who did not), valued commonsense, taking its theories to be approximations to the scientific truths of the day, and considered scientific truths as series of approximations to the absolute truth [Agassi, 1981, 112-16]. In particular, all three viewed science as the bold flight of the imagination checked and tempered by experience [Russell, 1931, 102]; [Einstein, 1949, 680]. Insofar as Russell adumbrated Popper\u2019s philosophy, it may be fair to consider the latter a streamlined version of the former (the way both Berkeley and Hume deemed their philosophies streamlined versions of Locke\u2019s [Hattiangadi, 1985]; [Wettersten, l985]. Russell raised the level of rational discourse in philosophy while remaining within the empiricist tradition; Popper continued and consolidated Russell\u2019s achievements, adding a broad modification of the rationalist tradition [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24], thus forging new ways of philosophizing [Lakatos, 1978, 10]. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between rationalism and irrationalism, between individualism and collectivism, as well as between radicalism and traditionalism. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between empiricism and intellectualism.',

 {'abstract': u'On September 17, 1994, Karl Popper died at the age of 92.He was described as the official opposition of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d, the philosophical club which in the inter-war period was glamorous and which espoused the then popular doctrine of logical positivism, so-called. His relations with that club were friendly-hostile, to use the term with which he liked to characterize the relations between scientific researchers. He is the last of that generation (unless it is Carl G. Hempel, who, however, sees himself as too young to belong there). The public aspect of Popper\u2019s friendly-hostile relations with his Viennese peers was unfortunately more hostile than friendly. Somehow, philosophers have managed to keep the accounts open for too long. The end of the era is the time to close accounts so as to be able to go on with the job at hand, since the intermingling of personal affairs with objective knowledge is unhealthy. Yet most of the leading heirs of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d still coast around the issues raised by Popper, and so they can neither overlook him nor quote him correctly. If past evidence is reliable here, then this will alter just about now. Is it?',

 {'abstract': u"Self- Deception in General &#34;A Liberal Decalogue&#34; suggests (Russell, 1967, pp. 60-61) not to envy people who live in a fool's paradise: It is a place only for fools. This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason. Later on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and even called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to his annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

Clearly, in some sense or another everyone interferes with the personality of people with whom they interact; yet what is meant here is something much more drastic than friends influencing one another's tastes or opinions; it is something more dramatic and more large scale.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

({'abstract': u"The liberal approach to ethics quite naturally tends toward the classic individualistic theory of society, to reductionism or psychologism so-called, that is, to a reduction of all social action to individual action. For example, liberalism allows one to experiment with new medications on one's own body. By extension, liberalism allows one to experiment, it seems, on another person's body with new medication if one acts as the other person's agent, that is, if one has the other person's proper consent. We all know that new medicines are introduced into the market experimentally; indeed, government agencies, such as food and drug administrations, are supposed to supervise such experimentations and eliminate from the market as quickly as possible new (or old) medications that prove harmful. Hence, the very introduction of a new medicine into the market requires the consent of the public - in the form of proper permits to manufacture and market new (and old) drugs and other medications.",

 {'abstract': u'Two suggestions are at the back of the present talk. First, toleration is obligatory, not criticism. So do not try to make people critically-minded: do not force them in any way to try to offer or accept criticism, to learn to participate effectively in the game of critical discussion. If they refuse, then they are within their right. Also, they will easily ad vance excuses for their refusal; admittedly some of these are unreasonable, but not all.',

 {'abstract': u'Karl R. Popper is \u201cthe outstanding philosopher of the twentieth century\u201d (Bryan Magee), even \u201cthe greatest thinker of the [twentieth] century\u201d (Gellner). He felt affinity with thinkers of the Age of Reason and developed a new version of rationalism: critical rationalism. As a champion of science and of democracy he was the most influential philosopher of the post-WWII era. He was a close follower of Bertrand Russell and of Albert Einstein in that all three advocated problem-oriented fallibilism (during the peak of the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein who did not), valued commonsense, taking its theories to be approximations to the scientific truths of the day, and considered scientific truths as series of approximations to the absolute truth [Agassi, 1981, 112-16]. In particular, all three viewed science as the bold flight of the imagination checked and tempered by experience [Russell, 1931, 102]; [Einstein, 1949, 680]. Insofar as Russell adumbrated Popper\u2019s philosophy, it may be fair to consider the latter a streamlined version of the former (the way both Berkeley and Hume deemed their philosophies streamlined versions of Locke\u2019s [Hattiangadi, 1985]; [Wettersten, l985]. Russell raised the level of rational discourse in philosophy while remaining within the empiricist tradition; Popper continued and consolidated Russell\u2019s achievements, adding a broad modification of the rationalist tradition [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24], thus forging new ways of philosophizing [Lakatos, 1978, 10]. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between rationalism and irrationalism, between individualism and collectivism, as well as between radicalism and traditionalism. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between empiricism and intellectualism.',

 {'abstract': u'On September 17, 1994, Karl Popper died at the age of 92.He was described as the official opposition of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d, the philosophical club which in the inter-war period was glamorous and which espoused the then popular doctrine of logical positivism, so-called. His relations with that club were friendly-hostile, to use the term with which he liked to characterize the relations between scientific researchers. He is the last of that generation (unless it is Carl G. Hempel, who, however, sees himself as too young to belong there). The public aspect of Popper\u2019s friendly-hostile relations with his Viennese peers was unfortunately more hostile than friendly. Somehow, philosophers have managed to keep the accounts open for too long. The end of the era is the time to close accounts so as to be able to go on with the job at hand, since the intermingling of personal affairs with objective knowledge is unhealthy. Yet most of the leading heirs of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d still coast around the issues raised by Popper, and so they can neither overlook him nor quote him correctly. If past evidence is reliable here, then this will alter just about now. Is it?',

A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively.

Later on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and even called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to his annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

 {'abstract': u"The variety of languages in the world is considered a curse by some, who view the phenomenon as a Tower of Babel. Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

 {'abstract': u"The word &#34;brain-washing&#34;, translated from Chinese communist jargon, is a very strong metaphor, first popularized by Robert Jay Lifto n. It vividly describes one person interfering with the personality make-up of another, removing the other's ideology and replacing it, and similarly tampering with the other's tastes, pool of information to rely upon and whatever else goes into the make-up of the other's personality. Clearly, in some sense or another everyone interferes with the personality of people with whom they interact; yet what is meant here is something much more drastic than friends influencing one another's tastes or opinions; it is something more dramatic and more large scale.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

({'abstract': u"The liberal approach to ethics quite naturally tends toward the classic individualistic theory of society, to reductionism or psychologism so-called, that is, to a reduction of all social action to individual action. For example, liberalism allows one to experiment with new medications on one's own body. By extension, liberalism allows one to experiment, it seems, on another person's body with new medication if one acts as the other person's agent, that is, if one has the other person's proper consent. We all know that new medicines are introduced into the market experimentally; indeed, government agencies, such as food and drug administrations, are supposed to supervise such experimentations and eliminate from the market as quickly as possible new (or old) medications that prove harmful. Hence, the very introduction of a new medicine into the market requires the consent of the public - in the form of proper permits to manufacture and market new (and old) drugs and other medications.",

So do not try to make people critically-minded: do not force them in any way to try to offer or accept criticism, to learn to participate effectively in the game of critical discussion.

 {'abstract': u'Karl R. Popper is \u201cthe outstanding philosopher of the twentieth century\u201d (Bryan Magee), even \u201cthe greatest thinker of the [twentieth] century\u201d (Gellner). He felt affinity with thinkers of the Age of Reason and developed a new version of rationalism: critical rationalism. As a champion of science and of democracy he was the most influential philosopher of the post-WWII era. He was a close follower of Bertrand Russell and of Albert Einstein in that all three advocated problem-oriented fallibilism (during the peak of the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein who did not), valued commonsense, taking its theories to be approximations to the scientific truths of the day, and considered scientific truths as series of approximations to the absolute truth [Agassi, 1981, 112-16]. In particular, all three viewed science as the bold flight of the imagination checked and tempered by experience [Russell, 1931, 102]; [Einstein, 1949, 680]. Insofar as Russell adumbrated Popper\u2019s philosophy, it may be fair to consider the latter a streamlined version of the former (the way both Berkeley and Hume deemed their philosophies streamlined versions of Locke\u2019s [Hattiangadi, 1985]; [Wettersten, l985]. Russell raised the level of rational discourse in philosophy while remaining within the empiricist tradition; Popper continued and consolidated Russell\u2019s achievements, adding a broad modification of the rationalist tradition [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24], thus forging new ways of philosophizing [Lakatos, 1978, 10]. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between rationalism and irrationalism, between individualism and collectivism, as well as between radicalism and traditionalism. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between empiricism and intellectualism.',

 {'abstract': u'On September 17, 1994, Karl Popper died at the age of 92.He was described as the official opposition of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d, the philosophical club which in the inter-war period was glamorous and which espoused the then popular doctrine of logical positivism, so-called. His relations with that club were friendly-hostile, to use the term with which he liked to characterize the relations between scientific researchers. He is the last of that generation (unless it is Carl G. Hempel, who, however, sees himself as too young to belong there). The public aspect of Popper\u2019s friendly-hostile relations with his Viennese peers was unfortunately more hostile than friendly. Somehow, philosophers have managed to keep the accounts open for too long. The end of the era is the time to close accounts so as to be able to go on with the job at hand, since the intermingling of personal affairs with objective knowledge is unhealthy. Yet most of the leading heirs of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d still coast around the issues raised by Popper, and so they can neither overlook him nor quote him correctly. If past evidence is reliable here, then this will alter just about now. Is it?',

 {'abstract': u'The traditional hermeneutic ruling not to use reports and legends for questioning edicts and rules signifies the tacit recognition, contrary to explicit statement, of the part of the Rabbinical leadership, of the inevitability of change in diverse aspects if Jewish life. This may invite criticism of the conduct of the ancient leadership, which, as always, is questionable and useless.',

 {'abstract': u"Self- Deception in General &#34;A Liberal Decalogue&#34; suggests (Russell, 1967, pp. 60-61) not to envy people who live in a fool's paradise: It is a place only for fools. This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason. Later on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and even called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to his annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

 {'abstract': u"If anything dramatic has happened in economic theory over the last one hundred years<i> \u2013</i> namely, since the advent of marginalism \u2013 then, everyone agrees, it was not the rise of the Chicago neo -classical school which, after all, only synthesized the various versions of marginalism, but the Keynesian Revolution. Assessments of this revolution were repeatedly invited, particularly by opponent, chiefly from Chicago. F. A. von Hayek has explicitly and bitterly blames Keynes for all our economic troubles; Harry Johnson has repeatedly declared the most revolutionary work of Keynes, his <i>General Theory</i> of 1936, so poor that but for its author's name on its title page it would have totally flopped. Can such a flop cause so much damage? Are these two assessments \u2013 of Hayek and of Johnson \u2013 in conflict or no t? Don Patinkin has raised a different question: how different is Keynes from his Chicago opponents, say, Milton Friedman? How many heads need roll, to use his metaphor, before a revolution may be declared? Patinkin sees Keynes as slightly deviant but stil l a member of the mainstream \u2013 the mainstream of the mainstream being Friedman and his Chicago followers, of course. Now, can a minor deviant be a flop? Can minor deviations from the true blue doctrine be to blame for all of our economic woes? I do not kno w.",

They all strike their new listener very forcefully; indeed, if you can find music lovers who have not heard one of these you can easily move them to tears by a good performance. Yet they wear out, some with the first hearing, some with the tenth. To be really both immediately very impressive and very durable, like Debussy's <i>Fetes</i> and Mozart's standard music, is every artist's dream, yet many serious composers prefer the durable over the immediately impressive, and take comfort in the fact that Bach's monumental works, <i>The Art of Fugue. The Musical Offering,</i> the <i>Goldberg Variations,</i>  and the <i>Mass in B Minor,</i> take a lot of sustained effort from their audience, as do most of Beethoven's later compositions, except for his ninth symphony and similar bits.",

 {'abstract': u"The liberal approach to ethics quite naturally tends toward the classic individualistic theory of society, to reductionism or psychologism so-called, that is, to a reduction of all social action to individual action. For example, liberalism allows one to experiment with new medications on one's own body. By extension, liberalism allows one to experiment, it seems, on another person's body with new medication if one acts as the other person's agent, that is, if one has the other person's proper consent. We all know that new medicines are introduced into the market experimentally; indeed, government agencies, such as food and drug administrations, are supposed to supervise such experimentations and eliminate from the market as quickly as possible new (or old) medications that prove harmful. Hence, the very introduction of a new medicine into the market requires the consent of the public - in the form of proper permits to manufacture and market new (and old) drugs and other medications.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl R. Popper is \u201cthe outstanding philosopher of the twentieth century\u201d (Bryan Magee), even \u201cthe greatest thinker of the [twentieth] century\u201d (Gellner). He felt affinity with thinkers of the Age of Reason and developed a new version of rationalism: critical rationalism. As a champion of science and of democracy he was the most influential philosopher of the post-WWII era. He was a close follower of Bertrand Russell and of Albert Einstein in that all three advocated problem-oriented fallibilism (during the peak of the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein who did not), valued commonsense, taking its theories to be approximations to the scientific truths of the day, and considered scientific truths as series of approximations to the absolute truth [Agassi, 1981, 112-16]. In particular, all three viewed science as the bold flight of the imagination checked and tempered by experience [Russell, 1931, 102]; [Einstein, 1949, 680]. Insofar as Russell adumbrated Popper\u2019s philosophy, it may be fair to consider the latter a streamlined version of the former (the way both Berkeley and Hume deemed their philosophies streamlined versions of Locke\u2019s [Hattiangadi, 1985]; [Wettersten, l985]. Russell raised the level of rational discourse in philosophy while remaining within the empiricist tradition; Popper continued and consolidated Russell\u2019s achievements, adding a broad modification of the rationalist tradition [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24], thus forging new ways of philosophizing [Lakatos, 1978, 10]. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between rationalism and irrationalism, between individualism and collectivism, as well as between radicalism and traditionalism. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between empiricism and intellectualism.',

 {'abstract': u'On September 17, 1994, Karl Popper died at the age of 92.He was described as the official opposition of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d, the philosophical club which in the inter-war period was glamorous and which espoused the then popular doctrine of logical positivism, so-called. His relations with that club were friendly-hostile, to use the term with which he liked to characterize the relations between scientific researchers. He is the last of that generation (unless it is Carl G. Hempel, who, however, sees himself as too young to belong there). The public aspect of Popper\u2019s friendly-hostile relations with his Viennese peers was unfortunately more hostile than friendly. Somehow, philosophers have managed to keep the accounts open for too long. The end of the era is the time to close accounts so as to be able to go on with the job at hand, since the intermingling of personal affairs with objective knowledge is unhealthy. Yet most of the leading heirs of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d still coast around the issues raised by Popper, and so they can neither overlook him nor quote him correctly. If past evidence is reliable here, then this will alter just about now. Is it?',

This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

 {'abstract': u"If anything dramatic has happened in economic theory over the last one hundred years<i> \u2013</i> namely, since the advent of marginalism \u2013 then, everyone agrees, it was not the rise of the Chicago neo -classical school which, after all, only synthesized the various versions of marginalism, but the Keynesian Revolution. Assessments of this revolution were repeatedly invited, particularly by opponent, chiefly from Chicago. F. A. von Hayek has explicitly and bitterly blames Keynes for all our economic troubles; Harry Johnson has repeatedly declared the most revolutionary work of Keynes, his <i>General Theory</i> of 1936, so poor that but for its author's name on its title page it would have totally flopped. Can such a flop cause so much damage? Are these two assessments \u2013 of Hayek and of Johnson \u2013 in conflict or no t? Don Patinkin has raised a different question: how different is Keynes from his Chicago opponents, say, Milton Friedman? How many heads need roll, to use his metaphor, before a revolution may be declared? Patinkin sees Keynes as slightly deviant but stil l a member of the mainstream \u2013 the mainstream of the mainstream being Friedman and his Chicago followers, of course. Now, can a minor deviant be a flop? Can minor deviations from the true blue doctrine be to blame for all of our economic woes? I do not kno w.",

 {'abstract': u"Consider such light musical pieces as Schumann's and Debussy's <i>Arabesques,</i>  Schumann's <i>Traumerie,</i> Debussy's <i>Petite Suite,</i> Tschaikowsky's <i>Andante Cantabile,</i> and so on. They all strike their new listener very forcefully; indeed, if you can find music lovers who have not heard one of these you can easily move them to tears by a good performance. Yet they wear out, some with the first hearing, some with the tenth. To be really both immediately very impressive and very durable, like Debussy's <i>Fetes</i> and Mozart's standard music, is every artist's dream, yet many serious composers prefer the durable over the immediately impressive, and take comfort in the fact that Bach's monumental works, <i>The Art of Fugue. The Musical Offering,</i> the <i>Goldberg Variations,</i>  and the <i>Mass in B Minor,</i> take a lot of sustained effort from their audience, as do most of Beethoven's later compositions, except for his ninth symphony and similar bits.",

 {'abstract': u"The liberal approach to ethics quite naturally tends toward the classic individualistic theory of society, to reductionism or psychologism so-called, that is, to a reduction of all social action to individual action. For example, liberalism allows one to experiment with new medications on one's own body. By extension, liberalism allows one to experiment, it seems, on another person's body with new medication if one acts as the other person's agent, that is, if one has the other person's proper consent. We all know that new medicines are introduced into the market experimentally; indeed, government agencies, such as food and drug administrations, are supposed to supervise such experimentations and eliminate from the market as quickly as possible new (or old) medications that prove harmful. Hence, the very introduction of a new medicine into the market requires the consent of the public - in the form of proper permits to manufacture and market new (and old) drugs and other medications.",

 {'abstract': u'Two suggestions are at the back of the present talk. First, toleration is obligatory, not criticism. So do not try to make people critically-minded: do not force them in any way to try to offer or accept criticism, to learn to participate effectively in the game of critical discussion. If they refuse, then they are within their right. Also, they will easily ad vance excuses for their refusal; admittedly some of these are unreasonable, but not all.',

 {'abstract': u'Karl R. Popper is \u201cthe outstanding philosopher of the twentieth century\u201d (Bryan Magee), even \u201cthe greatest thinker of the [twentieth] century\u201d (Gellner). He felt affinity with thinkers of the Age of Reason and developed a new version of rationalism: critical rationalism. As a champion of science and of democracy he was the most influential philosopher of the post-WWII era. He was a close follower of Bertrand Russell and of Albert Einstein in that all three advocated problem-oriented fallibilism (during the peak of the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein who did not), valued commonsense, taking its theories to be approximations to the scientific truths of the day, and considered scientific truths as series of approximations to the absolute truth [Agassi, 1981, 112-16]. In particular, all three viewed science as the bold flight of the imagination checked and tempered by experience [Russell, 1931, 102]; [Einstein, 1949, 680]. Insofar as Russell adumbrated Popper\u2019s philosophy, it may be fair to consider the latter a streamlined version of the former (the way both Berkeley and Hume deemed their philosophies streamlined versions of Locke\u2019s [Hattiangadi, 1985]; [Wettersten, l985]. Russell raised the level of rational discourse in philosophy while remaining within the empiricist tradition; Popper continued and consolidated Russell\u2019s achievements, adding a broad modification of the rationalist tradition [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24], thus forging new ways of philosophizing [Lakatos, 1978, 10]. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between rationalism and irrationalism, between individualism and collectivism, as well as between radicalism and traditionalism. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between empiricism and intellectualism.',

 {'abstract': u'On September 17, 1994, Karl Popper died at the age of 92.He was described as the official opposition of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d, the philosophical club which in the inter-war period was glamorous and which espoused the then popular doctrine of logical positivism, so-called. His relations with that club were friendly-hostile, to use the term with which he liked to characterize the relations between scientific researchers. He is the last of that generation (unless it is Carl G. Hempel, who, however, sees himself as too young to belong there). The public aspect of Popper\u2019s friendly-hostile relations with his Viennese peers was unfortunately more hostile than friendly. Somehow, philosophers have managed to keep the accounts open for too long. The end of the era is the time to close accounts so as to be able to go on with the job at hand, since the intermingling of personal affairs with objective knowledge is unhealthy. Yet most of the leading heirs of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d still coast around the issues raised by Popper, and so they can neither overlook him nor quote him correctly. If past evidence is reliable here, then this will alter just about now. Is it?',

A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason. Later on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and even called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to his annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

 {'abstract': u"The variety of languages in the world is considered a curse by some, who view the phenomenon as a Tower of Babel. Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

 {'abstract': u"The word &#34;brain-washing&#34;, translated from Chinese communist jargon, is a very strong metaphor, first popularized by Robert Jay Lifto n. It vividly describes one person interfering with the personality make-up of another, removing the other's ideology and replacing it, and similarly tampering with the other's tastes, pool of information to rely upon and whatever else goes into the make-up of the other's personality. Clearly, in some sense or another everyone interferes with the personality of people with whom they interact; yet what is meant here is something much more drastic than friends influencing one another's tastes or opinions; it is something more dramatic and more large scale.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

({'abstract': u'The ills of psychiatry are currently diagnoses with the aid of deficient etiologies. The currently proposed prescriptions for psychiatry are practically impossible. The defective part of the profession is its leadership which in its very defensiveness sticks to the status quo, thereby owning the worst defects and impeding all possible cure. The current discussions of the matter are pretentious and thus woolly. The minimal requirement from the profession as a whole and from each of its individual members is that they be not defensive and clear. In this vein I offer here preliminary discussions of propriety, of responsibility and of science.',

 {'abstract': u"If anything dramatic has happened in economic theory over the last one hundred years<i> \u2013</i> namely, since the advent of marginalism \u2013 then, everyone agrees, it was not the rise of the Chicago neo -classical school which, after all, only synthesized the various versions of marginalism, but the Keynesian Revolution. Assessments of this revolution were repeatedly invited, particularly by opponent, chiefly from Chicago. F. A. von Hayek has explicitly and bitterly blames Keynes for all our economic troubles; Harry Johnson has repeatedly declared the most revolutionary work of Keynes, his <i>General Theory</i> of 1936, so poor that but for its author's name on its title page it would have totally flopped. Can such a flop cause so much damage? Are these two assessments \u2013 of Hayek and of Johnson \u2013 in conflict or no t? Don Patinkin has raised a different question: how different is Keynes from his Chicago opponents, say, Milton Friedman? How many heads need roll, to use his metaphor, before a revolution may be declared? Patinkin sees Keynes as slightly deviant but stil l a member of the mainstream \u2013 the mainstream of the mainstream being Friedman and his Chicago followers, of course. Now, can a minor deviant be a flop? Can minor deviations from the true blue doctrine be to blame for all of our economic woes? I do not kno w.",

They all strike their new listener very forcefully; indeed, if you can find music lovers who have not heard one of these you can easily move them to tears by a good performance. Yet they wear out, some with the first hearing, some with the tenth. To be really both immediately very impressive and very durable, like Debussy's <i>Fetes</i> and Mozart's standard music, is every artist's dream, yet many serious composers prefer the durable over the immediately impressive, and take comfort in the fact that Bach's monumental works, <i>The Art of Fugue. The Musical Offering,</i> the <i>Goldberg Variations,</i>  and the <i>Mass in B Minor,</i> take a lot of sustained effort from their audience, as do most of Beethoven's later compositions, except for his ninth symphony and similar bits.",

 {'abstract': u"The liberal approach to ethics quite naturally tends toward the classic individualistic theory of society, to reductionism or psychologism so-called, that is, to a reduction of all social action to individual action. For example, liberalism allows one to experiment with new medications on one's own body. By extension, liberalism allows one to experiment, it seems, on another person's body with new medication if one acts as the other person's agent, that is, if one has the other person's proper consent. We all know that new medicines are introduced into the market experimentally; indeed, government agencies, such as food and drug administrations, are supposed to supervise such experimentations and eliminate from the market as quickly as possible new (or old) medications that prove harmful. Hence, the very introduction of a new medicine into the market requires the consent of the public - in the form of proper permits to manufacture and market new (and old) drugs and other medications.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl R. Popper is \u201cthe outstanding philosopher of the twentieth century\u201d (Bryan Magee), even \u201cthe greatest thinker of the [twentieth] century\u201d (Gellner). He felt affinity with thinkers of the Age of Reason and developed a new version of rationalism: critical rationalism. As a champion of science and of democracy he was the most influential philosopher of the post-WWII era. He was a close follower of Bertrand Russell and of Albert Einstein in that all three advocated problem-oriented fallibilism (during the peak of the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein who did not), valued commonsense, taking its theories to be approximations to the scientific truths of the day, and considered scientific truths as series of approximations to the absolute truth [Agassi, 1981, 112-16]. In particular, all three viewed science as the bold flight of the imagination checked and tempered by experience [Russell, 1931, 102]; [Einstein, 1949, 680]. Insofar as Russell adumbrated Popper\u2019s philosophy, it may be fair to consider the latter a streamlined version of the former (the way both Berkeley and Hume deemed their philosophies streamlined versions of Locke\u2019s [Hattiangadi, 1985]; [Wettersten, l985]. Russell raised the level of rational discourse in philosophy while remaining within the empiricist tradition; Popper continued and consolidated Russell\u2019s achievements, adding a broad modification of the rationalist tradition [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24], thus forging new ways of philosophizing [Lakatos, 1978, 10]. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between rationalism and irrationalism, between individualism and collectivism, as well as between radicalism and traditionalism. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between empiricism and intellectualism.',

 {'abstract': u'On September 17, 1994, Karl Popper died at the age of 92.He was described as the official opposition of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d, the philosophical club which in the inter-war period was glamorous and which espoused the then popular doctrine of logical positivism, so-called. His relations with that club were friendly-hostile, to use the term with which he liked to characterize the relations between scientific researchers. He is the last of that generation (unless it is Carl G. Hempel, who, however, sees himself as too young to belong there). The public aspect of Popper\u2019s friendly-hostile relations with his Viennese peers was unfortunately more hostile than friendly. Somehow, philosophers have managed to keep the accounts open for too long. The end of the era is the time to close accounts so as to be able to go on with the job at hand, since the intermingling of personal affairs with objective knowledge is unhealthy. Yet most of the leading heirs of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d still coast around the issues raised by Popper, and so they can neither overlook him nor quote him correctly. If past evidence is reliable here, then this will alter just about now. Is it?',

A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively.

Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

 {'abstract': u"The word &#34;brain-washing&#34;, translated from Chinese communist jargon, is a very strong metaphor, first popularized by Robert Jay Lifto n. It vividly describes one person interfering with the personality make-up of another, removing the other's ideology and replacing it, and similarly tampering with the other's tastes, pool of information to rely upon and whatever else goes into the make-up of the other's personality. Clearly, in some sense or another everyone interferes with the personality of people with whom they interact; yet what is meant here is something much more drastic than friends influencing one another's tastes or opinions; it is something more dramatic and more large scale.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

({'abstract': u'The following brief study touches upon a very small fraction of the vast anonymous theological literature of modern times. The very concept of anonymity has a diversity of flavors, from the oriental and ancient Western, through the medieval, to the modern: proper anonymity is possible only in a culture where authorship is usually boasted of, and where the mock ascriptions of the kind we find either in the <i>Song of Songs</i> or in the <i>Book of Splendour</i> (vulgarly described as forgeries) is out of the question to the point that it is normally looked upon as a form of forgery. That is to say, properly anonymous books were not written before the scientific revolution. Dating this revolution can be somewhat flexible. Some historians take 1600 or thereabouts as the proper cut-off date, with the burning of Giordano Bruno at the stake as the last act of its kind of flagrant medieval barbarism. Some take it to be the year 1660, the date of the founding of the Royal Society of London and the institution of its standards of scientific protocol \u2013 standards that were adopted as a matter of course by all its daughters.',

 {'abstract': u'<i>The Process of Education</i> was the outcome of the historic Woods Hall Conference of 1959 where ideas were chewed by the cleverest activists Bruner could invite in hopes of planning education anew. The conference, headed by Bruner, consisted of thirty-five participants who served as distinguished representatives of lustrous new educational experiments. These representatives included two historians as well as scientists, scholars, and educationists, under the distinguished auspices of the U.S. National Academy of Science. Some of the conference participants greatly assisted Bruner in developing this book through their &#34;on the spot&#34; deliberations. The results of these deliberations were summed up in various reports, selections of which are incorporated in <i>The Process of Education</i>.',

 {'abstract': u'The context of a scientific theory can be epistemological and methodological. Or it car be metaphysical, relating to the intellectual framework within which we cast it. Or it can be intertheoretical, both synchronically and diachronically. My concern here will be mainly diachronical -- the historical context of quantum theory, what is required of it vis -a-vis that context and how well it fulfills this requirement. But I shall come to this only at the later part of this essay. I shall have to clear the 3round by discussing the epistemic and metaphysical contexts first.',

 {'abstract': u'The ills of psychiatry are currently diagnoses with the aid of deficient etiologies. The currently proposed prescriptions for psychiatry are practically impossible. The defective part of the profession is its leadership which in its very defensiveness sticks to the status quo, thereby owning the worst defects and impeding all possible cure. The current discussions of the matter are pretentious and thus woolly. The minimal requirement from the profession as a whole and from each of its individual members is that they be not defensive and clear. In this vein I offer here preliminary discussions of propriety, of responsibility and of science.',

Assessments of this revolution were repeatedly invited, particularly by opponent, chiefly from Chicago. F. A. von Hayek has explicitly and bitterly blames Keynes for all our economic troubles; Harry Johnson has repeatedly declared the most revolutionary work of Keynes, his <i>General Theory</i> of 1936, so poor that but for its author's name on its title page it would have totally flopped. Can such a flop cause so much damage? Are these two assessments \u2013 of Hayek and of Johnson \u2013 in conflict or no t? Don Patinkin has raised a different question: how different is Keynes from his Chicago opponents, say, Milton Friedman? How many heads need roll, to use his metaphor, before a revolution may be declared? Patinkin sees Keynes as slightly deviant but stil l a member of the mainstream \u2013 the mainstream of the mainstream being Friedman and his Chicago followers, of course. Now, can a minor deviant be a flop? Can minor deviations from the true blue doctrine be to blame for all of our economic woes? I do not kno w.",

Yet they wear out, some with the first hearing, some with the tenth. To be really both immediately very impressive and very durable, like Debussy's <i>Fetes</i> and Mozart's standard music, is every artist's dream, yet many serious composers prefer the durable over the immediately impressive, and take comfort in the fact that Bach's monumental works, <i>The Art of Fugue. The Musical Offering,</i> the <i>Goldberg Variations,</i>  and the <i>Mass in B Minor,</i> take a lot of sustained effort from their audience, as do most of Beethoven's later compositions, except for his ninth symphony and similar bits.",

 {'abstract': u"The liberal approach to ethics quite naturally tends toward the classic individualistic theory of society, to reductionism or psychologism so-called, that is, to a reduction of all social action to individual action. For example, liberalism allows one to experiment with new medications on one's own body. By extension, liberalism allows one to experiment, it seems, on another person's body with new medication if one acts as the other person's agent, that is, if one has the other person's proper consent. We all know that new medicines are introduced into the market experimentally; indeed, government agencies, such as food and drug administrations, are supposed to supervise such experimentations and eliminate from the market as quickly as possible new (or old) medications that prove harmful. Hence, the very introduction of a new medicine into the market requires the consent of the public - in the form of proper permits to manufacture and market new (and old) drugs and other medications.",

So do not try to make people critically-minded: do not force them in any way to try to offer or accept criticism, to learn to participate effectively in the game of critical discussion.

 {'abstract': u'Karl R. Popper is \u201cthe outstanding philosopher of the twentieth century\u201d (Bryan Magee), even \u201cthe greatest thinker of the [twentieth] century\u201d (Gellner). He felt affinity with thinkers of the Age of Reason and developed a new version of rationalism: critical rationalism. As a champion of science and of democracy he was the most influential philosopher of the post-WWII era. He was a close follower of Bertrand Russell and of Albert Einstein in that all three advocated problem-oriented fallibilism (during the peak of the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein who did not), valued commonsense, taking its theories to be approximations to the scientific truths of the day, and considered scientific truths as series of approximations to the absolute truth [Agassi, 1981, 112-16]. In particular, all three viewed science as the bold flight of the imagination checked and tempered by experience [Russell, 1931, 102]; [Einstein, 1949, 680]. Insofar as Russell adumbrated Popper\u2019s philosophy, it may be fair to consider the latter a streamlined version of the former (the way both Berkeley and Hume deemed their philosophies streamlined versions of Locke\u2019s [Hattiangadi, 1985]; [Wettersten, l985]. Russell raised the level of rational discourse in philosophy while remaining within the empiricist tradition; Popper continued and consolidated Russell\u2019s achievements, adding a broad modification of the rationalist tradition [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24], thus forging new ways of philosophizing [Lakatos, 1978, 10]. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between rationalism and irrationalism, between individualism and collectivism, as well as between radicalism and traditionalism. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between empiricism and intellectualism.',

 {'abstract': u'On September 17, 1994, Karl Popper died at the age of 92.He was described as the official opposition of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d, the philosophical club which in the inter-war period was glamorous and which espoused the then popular doctrine of logical positivism, so-called. His relations with that club were friendly-hostile, to use the term with which he liked to characterize the relations between scientific researchers. He is the last of that generation (unless it is Carl G. Hempel, who, however, sees himself as too young to belong there). The public aspect of Popper\u2019s friendly-hostile relations with his Viennese peers was unfortunately more hostile than friendly. Somehow, philosophers have managed to keep the accounts open for too long. The end of the era is the time to close accounts so as to be able to go on with the job at hand, since the intermingling of personal affairs with objective knowledge is unhealthy. Yet most of the leading heirs of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d still coast around the issues raised by Popper, and so they can neither overlook him nor quote him correctly. If past evidence is reliable here, then this will alter just about now. Is it?',

Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason. Later on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and even called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to his annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

 {'abstract': u"The variety of languages in the world is considered a curse by some, who view the phenomenon as a Tower of Babel. Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

 {'abstract': u"The word &#34;brain-washing&#34;, translated from Chinese communist jargon, is a very strong metaphor, first popularized by Robert Jay Lifto n. It vividly describes one person interfering with the personality make-up of another, removing the other's ideology and replacing it, and similarly tampering with the other's tastes, pool of information to rely upon and whatever else goes into the make-up of the other's personality. Clearly, in some sense or another everyone interferes with the personality of people with whom they interact; yet what is meant here is something much more drastic than friends influencing one another's tastes or opinions; it is something more dramatic and more large scale.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

({'abstract': u'The following brief study touches upon a very small fraction of the vast anonymous theological literature of modern times. The very concept of anonymity has a diversity of flavors, from the oriental and ancient Western, through the medieval, to the modern: proper anonymity is possible only in a culture where authorship is usually boasted of, and where the mock ascriptions of the kind we find either in the <i>Song of Songs</i> or in the <i>Book of Splendour</i> (vulgarly described as forgeries) is out of the question to the point that it is normally looked upon as a form of forgery. That is to say, properly anonymous books were not written before the scientific revolution. Dating this revolution can be somewhat flexible. Some historians take 1600 or thereabouts as the proper cut-off date, with the burning of Giordano Bruno at the stake as the last act of its kind of flagrant medieval barbarism. Some take it to be the year 1660, the date of the founding of the Royal Society of London and the institution of its standards of scientific protocol \u2013 standards that were adopted as a matter of course by all its daughters.',

 {'abstract': u'<i>The Process of Education</i> was the outcome of the historic Woods Hall Conference of 1959 where ideas were chewed by the cleverest activists Bruner could invite in hopes of planning education anew. The conference, headed by Bruner, consisted of thirty-five participants who served as distinguished representatives of lustrous new educational experiments. These representatives included two historians as well as scientists, scholars, and educationists, under the distinguished auspices of the U.S. National Academy of Science. Some of the conference participants greatly assisted Bruner in developing this book through their &#34;on the spot&#34; deliberations. The results of these deliberations were summed up in various reports, selections of which are incorporated in <i>The Process of Education</i>.',

 {'abstract': u'The context of a scientific theory can be epistemological and methodological. Or it car be metaphysical, relating to the intellectual framework within which we cast it. Or it can be intertheoretical, both synchronically and diachronically. My concern here will be mainly diachronical -- the historical context of quantum theory, what is required of it vis -a-vis that context and how well it fulfills this requirement. But I shall come to this only at the later part of this essay. I shall have to clear the 3round by discussing the epistemic and metaphysical contexts first.',

 {'abstract': u'The ills of psychiatry are currently diagnoses with the aid of deficient etiologies. The currently proposed prescriptions for psychiatry are practically impossible. The defective part of the profession is its leadership which in its very defensiveness sticks to the status quo, thereby owning the worst defects and impeding all possible cure. The current discussions of the matter are pretentious and thus woolly. The minimal requirement from the profession as a whole and from each of its individual members is that they be not defensive and clear. In this vein I offer here preliminary discussions of propriety, of responsibility and of science.',

Assessments of this revolution were repeatedly invited, particularly by opponent, chiefly from Chicago. F. A. von Hayek has explicitly and bitterly blames Keynes for all our economic troubles; Harry Johnson has repeatedly declared the most revolutionary work of Keynes, his <i>General Theory</i> of 1936, so poor that but for its author's name on its title page it would have totally flopped. Can such a flop cause so much damage? Are these two assessments \u2013 of Hayek and of Johnson \u2013 in conflict or no t? Don Patinkin has raised a different question: how different is Keynes from his Chicago opponents, say, Milton Friedman? How many heads need roll, to use his metaphor, before a revolution may be declared? Patinkin sees Keynes as slightly deviant but stil l a member of the mainstream \u2013 the mainstream of the mainstream being Friedman and his Chicago followers, of course. Now, can a minor deviant be a flop? Can minor deviations from the true blue doctrine be to blame for all of our economic woes? I do not kno w.",

Yet they wear out, some with the first hearing, some with the tenth. To be really both immediately very impressive and very durable, like Debussy's <i>Fetes</i> and Mozart's standard music, is every artist's dream, yet many serious composers prefer the durable over the immediately impressive, and take comfort in the fact that Bach's monumental works, <i>The Art of Fugue. The Musical Offering,</i> the <i>Goldberg Variations,</i>  and the <i>Mass in B Minor,</i> take a lot of sustained effort from their audience, as do most of Beethoven's later compositions, except for his ninth symphony and similar bits.",

 {'abstract': u"The liberal approach to ethics quite naturally tends toward the classic individualistic theory of society, to reductionism or psychologism so-called, that is, to a reduction of all social action to individual action. For example, liberalism allows one to experiment with new medications on one's own body. By extension, liberalism allows one to experiment, it seems, on another person's body with new medication if one acts as the other person's agent, that is, if one has the other person's proper consent. We all know that new medicines are introduced into the market experimentally; indeed, government agencies, such as food and drug administrations, are supposed to supervise such experimentations and eliminate from the market as quickly as possible new (or old) medications that prove harmful. Hence, the very introduction of a new medicine into the market requires the consent of the public - in the form of proper permits to manufacture and market new (and old) drugs and other medications.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl R. Popper is \u201cthe outstanding philosopher of the twentieth century\u201d (Bryan Magee), even \u201cthe greatest thinker of the [twentieth] century\u201d (Gellner). He felt affinity with thinkers of the Age of Reason and developed a new version of rationalism: critical rationalism. As a champion of science and of democracy he was the most influential philosopher of the post-WWII era. He was a close follower of Bertrand Russell and of Albert Einstein in that all three advocated problem-oriented fallibilism (during the peak of the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein who did not), valued commonsense, taking its theories to be approximations to the scientific truths of the day, and considered scientific truths as series of approximations to the absolute truth [Agassi, 1981, 112-16]. In particular, all three viewed science as the bold flight of the imagination checked and tempered by experience [Russell, 1931, 102]; [Einstein, 1949, 680]. Insofar as Russell adumbrated Popper\u2019s philosophy, it may be fair to consider the latter a streamlined version of the former (the way both Berkeley and Hume deemed their philosophies streamlined versions of Locke\u2019s [Hattiangadi, 1985]; [Wettersten, l985]. Russell raised the level of rational discourse in philosophy while remaining within the empiricist tradition; Popper continued and consolidated Russell\u2019s achievements, adding a broad modification of the rationalist tradition [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24], thus forging new ways of philosophizing [Lakatos, 1978, 10]. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between rationalism and irrationalism, between individualism and collectivism, as well as between radicalism and traditionalism. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between empiricism and intellectualism.',

 {'abstract': u'On September 17, 1994, Karl Popper died at the age of 92.He was described as the official opposition of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d, the philosophical club which in the inter-war period was glamorous and which espoused the then popular doctrine of logical positivism, so-called. His relations with that club were friendly-hostile, to use the term with which he liked to characterize the relations between scientific researchers. He is the last of that generation (unless it is Carl G. Hempel, who, however, sees himself as too young to belong there). The public aspect of Popper\u2019s friendly-hostile relations with his Viennese peers was unfortunately more hostile than friendly. Somehow, philosophers have managed to keep the accounts open for too long. The end of the era is the time to close accounts so as to be able to go on with the job at hand, since the intermingling of personal affairs with objective knowledge is unhealthy. Yet most of the leading heirs of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d still coast around the issues raised by Popper, and so they can neither overlook him nor quote him correctly. If past evidence is reliable here, then this will alter just about now. Is it?',

A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively.

 {'abstract': u"The variety of languages in the world is considered a curse by some, who view the phenomenon as a Tower of Babel. Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

 {'abstract': u"The word &#34;brain-washing&#34;, translated from Chinese communist jargon, is a very strong metaphor, first popularized by Robert Jay Lifto n. It vividly describes one person interfering with the personality make-up of another, removing the other's ideology and replacing it, and similarly tampering with the other's tastes, pool of information to rely upon and whatever else goes into the make-up of the other's personality. Clearly, in some sense or another everyone interferes with the personality of people with whom they interact; yet what is meant here is something much more drastic than friends influencing one another's tastes or opinions; it is something more dramatic and more large scale.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

({'abstract': u'The following brief study touches upon a very small fraction of the vast anonymous theological literature of modern times. The very concept of anonymity has a diversity of flavors, from the oriental and ancient Western, through the medieval, to the modern: proper anonymity is possible only in a culture where authorship is usually boasted of, and where the mock ascriptions of the kind we find either in the <i>Song of Songs</i> or in the <i>Book of Splendour</i> (vulgarly described as forgeries) is out of the question to the point that it is normally looked upon as a form of forgery. That is to say, properly anonymous books were not written before the scientific revolution. Dating this revolution can be somewhat flexible. Some historians take 1600 or thereabouts as the proper cut-off date, with the burning of Giordano Bruno at the stake as the last act of its kind of flagrant medieval barbarism. Some take it to be the year 1660, the date of the founding of the Royal Society of London and the institution of its standards of scientific protocol \u2013 standards that were adopted as a matter of course by all its daughters.',

The conference, headed by Bruner, consisted of thirty-five participants who served as distinguished representatives of lustrous new educational experiments. These representatives included two historians as well as scientists, scholars, and educationists, under the distinguished auspices of the U.S. National Academy of Science. Some of the conference participants greatly assisted Bruner in developing this book through their &#34;on the spot&#34; deliberations. The results of these deliberations were summed up in various reports, selections of which are incorporated in <i>The Process of Education</i>.',

 {'abstract': u"If anything dramatic has happened in economic theory over the last one hundred years<i> \u2013</i> namely, since the advent of marginalism \u2013 then, everyone agrees, it was not the rise of the Chicago neo -classical school which, after all, only synthesized the various versions of marginalism, but the Keynesian Revolution. Assessments of this revolution were repeatedly invited, particularly by opponent, chiefly from Chicago. F. A. von Hayek has explicitly and bitterly blames Keynes for all our economic troubles; Harry Johnson has repeatedly declared the most revolutionary work of Keynes, his <i>General Theory</i> of 1936, so poor that but for its author's name on its title page it would have totally flopped. Can such a flop cause so much damage? Are these two assessments \u2013 of Hayek and of Johnson \u2013 in conflict or no t? Don Patinkin has raised a different question: how different is Keynes from his Chicago opponents, say, Milton Friedman? How many heads need roll, to use his metaphor, before a revolution may be declared? Patinkin sees Keynes as slightly deviant but stil l a member of the mainstream \u2013 the mainstream of the mainstream being Friedman and his Chicago followers, of course. Now, can a minor deviant be a flop? Can minor deviations from the true blue doctrine be to blame for all of our economic woes? I do not kno w.",

 {'abstract': u"Consider such light musical pieces as Schumann's and Debussy's <i>Arabesques,</i>  Schumann's <i>Traumerie,</i> Debussy's <i>Petite Suite,</i> Tschaikowsky's <i>Andante Cantabile,</i> and so on. They all strike their new listener very forcefully; indeed, if you can find music lovers who have not heard one of these you can easily move them to tears by a good performance. Yet they wear out, some with the first hearing, some with the tenth. To be really both immediately very impressive and very durable, like Debussy's <i>Fetes</i> and Mozart's standard music, is every artist's dream, yet many serious composers prefer the durable over the immediately impressive, and take comfort in the fact that Bach's monumental works, <i>The Art of Fugue. The Musical Offering,</i> the <i>Goldberg Variations,</i>  and the <i>Mass in B Minor,</i> take a lot of sustained effort from their audience, as do most of Beethoven's later compositions, except for his ninth symphony and similar bits.",

 {'abstract': u"The liberal approach to ethics quite naturally tends toward the classic individualistic theory of society, to reductionism or psychologism so-called, that is, to a reduction of all social action to individual action. For example, liberalism allows one to experiment with new medications on one's own body. By extension, liberalism allows one to experiment, it seems, on another person's body with new medication if one acts as the other person's agent, that is, if one has the other person's proper consent. We all know that new medicines are introduced into the market experimentally; indeed, government agencies, such as food and drug administrations, are supposed to supervise such experimentations and eliminate from the market as quickly as possible new (or old) medications that prove harmful. Hence, the very introduction of a new medicine into the market requires the consent of the public - in the form of proper permits to manufacture and market new (and old) drugs and other medications.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl R. Popper is \u201cthe outstanding philosopher of the twentieth century\u201d (Bryan Magee), even \u201cthe greatest thinker of the [twentieth] century\u201d (Gellner). He felt affinity with thinkers of the Age of Reason and developed a new version of rationalism: critical rationalism. As a champion of science and of democracy he was the most influential philosopher of the post-WWII era. He was a close follower of Bertrand Russell and of Albert Einstein in that all three advocated problem-oriented fallibilism (during the peak of the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein who did not), valued commonsense, taking its theories to be approximations to the scientific truths of the day, and considered scientific truths as series of approximations to the absolute truth [Agassi, 1981, 112-16]. In particular, all three viewed science as the bold flight of the imagination checked and tempered by experience [Russell, 1931, 102]; [Einstein, 1949, 680]. Insofar as Russell adumbrated Popper\u2019s philosophy, it may be fair to consider the latter a streamlined version of the former (the way both Berkeley and Hume deemed their philosophies streamlined versions of Locke\u2019s [Hattiangadi, 1985]; [Wettersten, l985]. Russell raised the level of rational discourse in philosophy while remaining within the empiricist tradition; Popper continued and consolidated Russell\u2019s achievements, adding a broad modification of the rationalist tradition [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24], thus forging new ways of philosophizing [Lakatos, 1978, 10]. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between rationalism and irrationalism, between individualism and collectivism, as well as between radicalism and traditionalism. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between empiricism and intellectualism.',

 {'abstract': u'On September 17, 1994, Karl Popper died at the age of 92.He was described as the official opposition of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d, the philosophical club which in the inter-war period was glamorous and which espoused the then popular doctrine of logical positivism, so-called. His relations with that club were friendly-hostile, to use the term with which he liked to characterize the relations between scientific researchers. He is the last of that generation (unless it is Carl G. Hempel, who, however, sees himself as too young to belong there). The public aspect of Popper\u2019s friendly-hostile relations with his Viennese peers was unfortunately more hostile than friendly. Somehow, philosophers have managed to keep the accounts open for too long. The end of the era is the time to close accounts so as to be able to go on with the job at hand, since the intermingling of personal affairs with objective knowledge is unhealthy. Yet most of the leading heirs of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d still coast around the issues raised by Popper, and so they can neither overlook him nor quote him correctly. If past evidence is reliable here, then this will alter just about now. Is it?',

This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

({'abstract': u'The following brief study touches upon a very small fraction of the vast anonymous theological literature of modern times. The very concept of anonymity has a diversity of flavors, from the oriental and ancient Western, through the medieval, to the modern: proper anonymity is possible only in a culture where authorship is usually boasted of, and where the mock ascriptions of the kind we find either in the <i>Song of Songs</i> or in the <i>Book of Splendour</i> (vulgarly described as forgeries) is out of the question to the point that it is normally looked upon as a form of forgery. That is to say, properly anonymous books were not written before the scientific revolution. Dating this revolution can be somewhat flexible. Some historians take 1600 or thereabouts as the proper cut-off date, with the burning of Giordano Bruno at the stake as the last act of its kind of flagrant medieval barbarism. Some take it to be the year 1660, the date of the founding of the Royal Society of London and the institution of its standards of scientific protocol \u2013 standards that were adopted as a matter of course by all its daughters.',

 {'abstract': u'<i>The Process of Education</i> was the outcome of the historic Woods Hall Conference of 1959 where ideas were chewed by the cleverest activists Bruner could invite in hopes of planning education anew. The conference, headed by Bruner, consisted of thirty-five participants who served as distinguished representatives of lustrous new educational experiments. These representatives included two historians as well as scientists, scholars, and educationists, under the distinguished auspices of the U.S. National Academy of Science. Some of the conference participants greatly assisted Bruner in developing this book through their &#34;on the spot&#34; deliberations. The results of these deliberations were summed up in various reports, selections of which are incorporated in <i>The Process of Education</i>.',

 {'abstract': u"If anything dramatic has happened in economic theory over the last one hundred years<i> \u2013</i> namely, since the advent of marginalism \u2013 then, everyone agrees, it was not the rise of the Chicago neo -classical school which, after all, only synthesized the various versions of marginalism, but the Keynesian Revolution. Assessments of this revolution were repeatedly invited, particularly by opponent, chiefly from Chicago. F. A. von Hayek has explicitly and bitterly blames Keynes for all our economic troubles; Harry Johnson has repeatedly declared the most revolutionary work of Keynes, his <i>General Theory</i> of 1936, so poor that but for its author's name on its title page it would have totally flopped. Can such a flop cause so much damage? Are these two assessments \u2013 of Hayek and of Johnson \u2013 in conflict or no t? Don Patinkin has raised a different question: how different is Keynes from his Chicago opponents, say, Milton Friedman? How many heads need roll, to use his metaphor, before a revolution may be declared? Patinkin sees Keynes as slightly deviant but stil l a member of the mainstream \u2013 the mainstream of the mainstream being Friedman and his Chicago followers, of course. Now, can a minor deviant be a flop? Can minor deviations from the true blue doctrine be to blame for all of our economic woes? I do not kno w.",

They all strike their new listener very forcefully; indeed, if you can find music lovers who have not heard one of these you can easily move them to tears by a good performance. Yet they wear out, some with the first hearing, some with the tenth. To be really both immediately very impressive and very durable, like Debussy's <i>Fetes</i> and Mozart's standard music, is every artist's dream, yet many serious composers prefer the durable over the immediately impressive, and take comfort in the fact that Bach's monumental works, <i>The Art of Fugue.

 {'abstract': u"The liberal approach to ethics quite naturally tends toward the classic individualistic theory of society, to reductionism or psychologism so-called, that is, to a reduction of all social action to individual action. For example, liberalism allows one to experiment with new medications on one's own body. By extension, liberalism allows one to experiment, it seems, on another person's body with new medication if one acts as the other person's agent, that is, if one has the other person's proper consent. We all know that new medicines are introduced into the market experimentally; indeed, government agencies, such as food and drug administrations, are supposed to supervise such experimentations and eliminate from the market as quickly as possible new (or old) medications that prove harmful. Hence, the very introduction of a new medicine into the market requires the consent of the public - in the form of proper permits to manufacture and market new (and old) drugs and other medications.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl R. Popper is \u201cthe outstanding philosopher of the twentieth century\u201d (Bryan Magee), even \u201cthe greatest thinker of the [twentieth] century\u201d (Gellner). He felt affinity with thinkers of the Age of Reason and developed a new version of rationalism: critical rationalism. As a champion of science and of democracy he was the most influential philosopher of the post-WWII era. He was a close follower of Bertrand Russell and of Albert Einstein in that all three advocated problem-oriented fallibilism (during the peak of the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein who did not), valued commonsense, taking its theories to be approximations to the scientific truths of the day, and considered scientific truths as series of approximations to the absolute truth [Agassi, 1981, 112-16]. In particular, all three viewed science as the bold flight of the imagination checked and tempered by experience [Russell, 1931, 102]; [Einstein, 1949, 680]. Insofar as Russell adumbrated Popper\u2019s philosophy, it may be fair to consider the latter a streamlined version of the former (the way both Berkeley and Hume deemed their philosophies streamlined versions of Locke\u2019s [Hattiangadi, 1985]; [Wettersten, l985]. Russell raised the level of rational discourse in philosophy while remaining within the empiricist tradition; Popper continued and consolidated Russell\u2019s achievements, adding a broad modification of the rationalist tradition [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24], thus forging new ways of philosophizing [Lakatos, 1978, 10]. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between rationalism and irrationalism, between individualism and collectivism, as well as between radicalism and traditionalism. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between empiricism and intellectualism.',

 {'abstract': u'On September 17, 1994, Karl Popper died at the age of 92.He was described as the official opposition of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d, the philosophical club which in the inter-war period was glamorous and which espoused the then popular doctrine of logical positivism, so-called. His relations with that club were friendly-hostile, to use the term with which he liked to characterize the relations between scientific researchers. He is the last of that generation (unless it is Carl G. Hempel, who, however, sees himself as too young to belong there). The public aspect of Popper\u2019s friendly-hostile relations with his Viennese peers was unfortunately more hostile than friendly. Somehow, philosophers have managed to keep the accounts open for too long. The end of the era is the time to close accounts so as to be able to go on with the job at hand, since the intermingling of personal affairs with objective knowledge is unhealthy. Yet most of the leading heirs of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d still coast around the issues raised by Popper, and so they can neither overlook him nor quote him correctly. If past evidence is reliable here, then this will alter just about now. Is it?',

This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

({'abstract': u'The following brief study touches upon a very small fraction of the vast anonymous theological literature of modern times. The very concept of anonymity has a diversity of flavors, from the oriental and ancient Western, through the medieval, to the modern: proper anonymity is possible only in a culture where authorship is usually boasted of, and where the mock ascriptions of the kind we find either in the <i>Song of Songs</i> or in the <i>Book of Splendour</i> (vulgarly described as forgeries) is out of the question to the point that it is normally looked upon as a form of forgery. That is to say, properly anonymous books were not written before the scientific revolution. Dating this revolution can be somewhat flexible. Some historians take 1600 or thereabouts as the proper cut-off date, with the burning of Giordano Bruno at the stake as the last act of its kind of flagrant medieval barbarism. Some take it to be the year 1660, the date of the founding of the Royal Society of London and the institution of its standards of scientific protocol \u2013 standards that were adopted as a matter of course by all its daughters.',

 {'abstract': u'<i>The Process of Education</i> was the outcome of the historic Woods Hall Conference of 1959 where ideas were chewed by the cleverest activists Bruner could invite in hopes of planning education anew. The conference, headed by Bruner, consisted of thirty-five participants who served as distinguished representatives of lustrous new educational experiments. These representatives included two historians as well as scientists, scholars, and educationists, under the distinguished auspices of the U.S. National Academy of Science. Some of the conference participants greatly assisted Bruner in developing this book through their &#34;on the spot&#34; deliberations. The results of these deliberations were summed up in various reports, selections of which are incorporated in <i>The Process of Education</i>.',

 {'abstract': u"If anything dramatic has happened in economic theory over the last one hundred years<i> \u2013</i> namely, since the advent of marginalism \u2013 then, everyone agrees, it was not the rise of the Chicago neo -classical school which, after all, only synthesized the various versions of marginalism, but the Keynesian Revolution. Assessments of this revolution were repeatedly invited, particularly by opponent, chiefly from Chicago. F. A. von Hayek has explicitly and bitterly blames Keynes for all our economic troubles; Harry Johnson has repeatedly declared the most revolutionary work of Keynes, his <i>General Theory</i> of 1936, so poor that but for its author's name on its title page it would have totally flopped. Can such a flop cause so much damage? Are these two assessments \u2013 of Hayek and of Johnson \u2013 in conflict or no t? Don Patinkin has raised a different question: how different is Keynes from his Chicago opponents, say, Milton Friedman? How many heads need roll, to use his metaphor, before a revolution may be declared? Patinkin sees Keynes as slightly deviant but stil l a member of the mainstream \u2013 the mainstream of the mainstream being Friedman and his Chicago followers, of course. Now, can a minor deviant be a flop? Can minor deviations from the true blue doctrine be to blame for all of our economic woes? I do not kno w.",

 {'abstract': u"Consider such light musical pieces as Schumann's and Debussy's <i>Arabesques,</i>  Schumann's <i>Traumerie,</i> Debussy's <i>Petite Suite,</i> Tschaikowsky's <i>Andante Cantabile,</i> and so on. They all strike their new listener very forcefully; indeed, if you can find music lovers who have not heard one of these you can easily move them to tears by a good performance. Yet they wear out, some with the first hearing, some with the tenth. To be really both immediately very impressive and very durable, like Debussy's <i>Fetes</i> and Mozart's standard music, is every artist's dream, yet many serious composers prefer the durable over the immediately impressive, and take comfort in the fact that Bach's monumental works, <i>The Art of Fugue. The Musical Offering,</i> the <i>Goldberg Variations,</i>  and the <i>Mass in B Minor,</i> take a lot of sustained effort from their audience, as do most of Beethoven's later compositions, except for his ninth symphony and similar bits.",

 {'abstract': u"The liberal approach to ethics quite naturally tends toward the classic individualistic theory of society, to reductionism or psychologism so-called, that is, to a reduction of all social action to individual action. For example, liberalism allows one to experiment with new medications on one's own body. By extension, liberalism allows one to experiment, it seems, on another person's body with new medication if one acts as the other person's agent, that is, if one has the other person's proper consent. We all know that new medicines are introduced into the market experimentally; indeed, government agencies, such as food and drug administrations, are supposed to supervise such experimentations and eliminate from the market as quickly as possible new (or old) medications that prove harmful. Hence, the very introduction of a new medicine into the market requires the consent of the public - in the form of proper permits to manufacture and market new (and old) drugs and other medications.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl R. Popper is \u201cthe outstanding philosopher of the twentieth century\u201d (Bryan Magee), even \u201cthe greatest thinker of the [twentieth] century\u201d (Gellner). He felt affinity with thinkers of the Age of Reason and developed a new version of rationalism: critical rationalism. As a champion of science and of democracy he was the most influential philosopher of the post-WWII era. He was a close follower of Bertrand Russell and of Albert Einstein in that all three advocated problem-oriented fallibilism (during the peak of the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein who did not), valued commonsense, taking its theories to be approximations to the scientific truths of the day, and considered scientific truths as series of approximations to the absolute truth [Agassi, 1981, 112-16]. In particular, all three viewed science as the bold flight of the imagination checked and tempered by experience [Russell, 1931, 102]; [Einstein, 1949, 680]. Insofar as Russell adumbrated Popper\u2019s philosophy, it may be fair to consider the latter a streamlined version of the former (the way both Berkeley and Hume deemed their philosophies streamlined versions of Locke\u2019s [Hattiangadi, 1985]; [Wettersten, l985]. Russell raised the level of rational discourse in philosophy while remaining within the empiricist tradition; Popper continued and consolidated Russell\u2019s achievements, adding a broad modification of the rationalist tradition [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24], thus forging new ways of philosophizing [Lakatos, 1978, 10]. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between rationalism and irrationalism, between individualism and collectivism, as well as between radicalism and traditionalism. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between empiricism and intellectualism.',

 {'abstract': u'On September 17, 1994, Karl Popper died at the age of 92.He was described as the official opposition of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d, the philosophical club which in the inter-war period was glamorous and which espoused the then popular doctrine of logical positivism, so-called. His relations with that club were friendly-hostile, to use the term with which he liked to characterize the relations between scientific researchers. He is the last of that generation (unless it is Carl G. Hempel, who, however, sees himself as too young to belong there). The public aspect of Popper\u2019s friendly-hostile relations with his Viennese peers was unfortunately more hostile than friendly. Somehow, philosophers have managed to keep the accounts open for too long. The end of the era is the time to close accounts so as to be able to go on with the job at hand, since the intermingling of personal affairs with objective knowledge is unhealthy. Yet most of the leading heirs of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d still coast around the issues raised by Popper, and so they can neither overlook him nor quote him correctly. If past evidence is reliable here, then this will alter just about now. Is it?',

 {'abstract': u"Self- Deception in General &#34;A Liberal Decalogue&#34; suggests (Russell, 1967, pp. 60-61) not to envy people who live in a fool's paradise: It is a place only for fools. This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason. Later on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and even called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to his annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

({'abstract': u'The following brief study touches upon a very small fraction of the vast anonymous theological literature of modern times. The very concept of anonymity has a diversity of flavors, from the oriental and ancient Western, through the medieval, to the modern: proper anonymity is possible only in a culture where authorship is usually boasted of, and where the mock ascriptions of the kind we find either in the <i>Song of Songs</i> or in the <i>Book of Splendour</i> (vulgarly described as forgeries) is out of the question to the point that it is normally looked upon as a form of forgery. That is to say, properly anonymous books were not written before the scientific revolution. Dating this revolution can be somewhat flexible. Some historians take 1600 or thereabouts as the proper cut-off date, with the burning of Giordano Bruno at the stake as the last act of its kind of flagrant medieval barbarism. Some take it to be the year 1660, the date of the founding of the Royal Society of London and the institution of its standards of scientific protocol \u2013 standards that were adopted as a matter of course by all its daughters.',

 {'abstract': u'<i>The Process of Education</i> was the outcome of the historic Woods Hall Conference of 1959 where ideas were chewed by the cleverest activists Bruner could invite in hopes of planning education anew. The conference, headed by Bruner, consisted of thirty-five participants who served as distinguished representatives of lustrous new educational experiments. These representatives included two historians as well as scientists, scholars, and educationists, under the distinguished auspices of the U.S. National Academy of Science. Some of the conference participants greatly assisted Bruner in developing this book through their &#34;on the spot&#34; deliberations. The results of these deliberations were summed up in various reports, selections of which are incorporated in <i>The Process of Education</i>.',

 {'abstract': u'The ills of psychiatry are currently diagnoses with the aid of deficient etiologies. The currently proposed prescriptions for psychiatry are practically impossible. The defective part of the profession is its leadership which in its very defensiveness sticks to the status quo, thereby owning the worst defects and impeding all possible cure. The current discussions of the matter are pretentious and thus woolly. The minimal requirement from the profession as a whole and from each of its individual members is that they be not defensive and clear. In this vein I offer here preliminary discussions of propriety, of responsibility and of science.',

Assessments of this revolution were repeatedly invited, particularly by opponent, chiefly from Chicago. F.

 {'abstract': u"Consider such light musical pieces as Schumann's and Debussy's <i>Arabesques,</i>  Schumann's <i>Traumerie,</i> Debussy's <i>Petite Suite,</i> Tschaikowsky's <i>Andante Cantabile,</i> and so on. They all strike their new listener very forcefully; indeed, if you can find music lovers who have not heard one of these you can easily move them to tears by a good performance. Yet they wear out, some with the first hearing, some with the tenth. To be really both immediately very impressive and very durable, like Debussy's <i>Fetes</i> and Mozart's standard music, is every artist's dream, yet many serious composers prefer the durable over the immediately impressive, and take comfort in the fact that Bach's monumental works, <i>The Art of Fugue. The Musical Offering,</i> the <i>Goldberg Variations,</i>  and the <i>Mass in B Minor,</i> take a lot of sustained effort from their audience, as do most of Beethoven's later compositions, except for his ninth symphony and similar bits.",

 {'abstract': u"The liberal approach to ethics quite naturally tends toward the classic individualistic theory of society, to reductionism or psychologism so-called, that is, to a reduction of all social action to individual action. For example, liberalism allows one to experiment with new medications on one's own body. By extension, liberalism allows one to experiment, it seems, on another person's body with new medication if one acts as the other person's agent, that is, if one has the other person's proper consent. We all know that new medicines are introduced into the market experimentally; indeed, government agencies, such as food and drug administrations, are supposed to supervise such experimentations and eliminate from the market as quickly as possible new (or old) medications that prove harmful. Hence, the very introduction of a new medicine into the market requires the consent of the public - in the form of proper permits to manufacture and market new (and old) drugs and other medications.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl R. Popper is \u201cthe outstanding philosopher of the twentieth century\u201d (Bryan Magee), even \u201cthe greatest thinker of the [twentieth] century\u201d (Gellner). He felt affinity with thinkers of the Age of Reason and developed a new version of rationalism: critical rationalism. As a champion of science and of democracy he was the most influential philosopher of the post-WWII era. He was a close follower of Bertrand Russell and of Albert Einstein in that all three advocated problem-oriented fallibilism (during the peak of the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein who did not), valued commonsense, taking its theories to be approximations to the scientific truths of the day, and considered scientific truths as series of approximations to the absolute truth [Agassi, 1981, 112-16]. In particular, all three viewed science as the bold flight of the imagination checked and tempered by experience [Russell, 1931, 102]; [Einstein, 1949, 680]. Insofar as Russell adumbrated Popper\u2019s philosophy, it may be fair to consider the latter a streamlined version of the former (the way both Berkeley and Hume deemed their philosophies streamlined versions of Locke\u2019s [Hattiangadi, 1985]; [Wettersten, l985]. Russell raised the level of rational discourse in philosophy while remaining within the empiricist tradition; Popper continued and consolidated Russell\u2019s achievements, adding a broad modification of the rationalist tradition [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24], thus forging new ways of philosophizing [Lakatos, 1978, 10]. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between rationalism and irrationalism, between individualism and collectivism, as well as between radicalism and traditionalism. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between empiricism and intellectualism.',

 {'abstract': u'On September 17, 1994, Karl Popper died at the age of 92.He was described as the official opposition of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d, the philosophical club which in the inter-war period was glamorous and which espoused the then popular doctrine of logical positivism, so-called. His relations with that club were friendly-hostile, to use the term with which he liked to characterize the relations between scientific researchers. He is the last of that generation (unless it is Carl G. Hempel, who, however, sees himself as too young to belong there). The public aspect of Popper\u2019s friendly-hostile relations with his Viennese peers was unfortunately more hostile than friendly. Somehow, philosophers have managed to keep the accounts open for too long. The end of the era is the time to close accounts so as to be able to go on with the job at hand, since the intermingling of personal affairs with objective knowledge is unhealthy. Yet most of the leading heirs of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d still coast around the issues raised by Popper, and so they can neither overlook him nor quote him correctly. If past evidence is reliable here, then this will alter just about now. Is it?',

 {'abstract': u"Self- Deception in General &#34;A Liberal Decalogue&#34; suggests (Russell, 1967, pp. 60-61) not to envy people who live in a fool's paradise: It is a place only for fools. This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason. Later on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and even called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to his annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

({'abstract': u'The following brief study touches upon a very small fraction of the vast anonymous theological literature of modern times. The very concept of anonymity has a diversity of flavors, from the oriental and ancient Western, through the medieval, to the modern: proper anonymity is possible only in a culture where authorship is usually boasted of, and where the mock ascriptions of the kind we find either in the <i>Song of Songs</i> or in the <i>Book of Splendour</i> (vulgarly described as forgeries) is out of the question to the point that it is normally looked upon as a form of forgery. That is to say, properly anonymous books were not written before the scientific revolution. Dating this revolution can be somewhat flexible. Some historians take 1600 or thereabouts as the proper cut-off date, with the burning of Giordano Bruno at the stake as the last act of its kind of flagrant medieval barbarism. Some take it to be the year 1660, the date of the founding of the Royal Society of London and the institution of its standards of scientific protocol \u2013 standards that were adopted as a matter of course by all its daughters.',

 {'abstract': u'<i>The Process of Education</i> was the outcome of the historic Woods Hall Conference of 1959 where ideas were chewed by the cleverest activists Bruner could invite in hopes of planning education anew. The conference, headed by Bruner, consisted of thirty-five participants who served as distinguished representatives of lustrous new educational experiments. These representatives included two historians as well as scientists, scholars, and educationists, under the distinguished auspices of the U.S. National Academy of Science. Some of the conference participants greatly assisted Bruner in developing this book through their &#34;on the spot&#34; deliberations. The results of these deliberations were summed up in various reports, selections of which are incorporated in <i>The Process of Education</i>.',

 {'abstract': u'The ills of psychiatry are currently diagnoses with the aid of deficient etiologies. The currently proposed prescriptions for psychiatry are practically impossible. The defective part of the profession is its leadership which in its very defensiveness sticks to the status quo, thereby owning the worst defects and impeding all possible cure. The current discussions of the matter are pretentious and thus woolly. The minimal requirement from the profession as a whole and from each of its individual members is that they be not defensive and clear. In this vein I offer here preliminary discussions of propriety, of responsibility and of science.',

Assessments of this revolution were repeatedly invited, particularly by opponent, chiefly from Chicago. F. A. von Hayek has explicitly and bitterly blames Keynes for all our economic troubles; Harry Johnson has repeatedly declared the most revolutionary work of Keynes, his <i>General Theory</i> of 1936, so poor that but for its author's name on its title page it would have totally flopped. Can such a flop cause so much damage? Are these two assessments \u2013 of Hayek and of Johnson \u2013 in conflict or no t? Don Patinkin has raised a different question: how different is Keynes from his Chicago opponents, say, Milton Friedman? How many heads need roll, to use his metaphor, before a revolution may be declared? Patinkin sees Keynes as slightly deviant but stil l a member of the mainstream \u2013 the mainstream of the mainstream being Friedman and his Chicago followers, of course.

 {'abstract': u"The liberal approach to ethics quite naturally tends toward the classic individualistic theory of society, to reductionism or psychologism so-called, that is, to a reduction of all social action to individual action. For example, liberalism allows one to experiment with new medications on one's own body. By extension, liberalism allows one to experiment, it seems, on another person's body with new medication if one acts as the other person's agent, that is, if one has the other person's proper consent. We all know that new medicines are introduced into the market experimentally; indeed, government agencies, such as food and drug administrations, are supposed to supervise such experimentations and eliminate from the market as quickly as possible new (or old) medications that prove harmful. Hence, the very introduction of a new medicine into the market requires the consent of the public - in the form of proper permits to manufacture and market new (and old) drugs and other medications.",

 {'abstract': u'Two suggestions are at the back of the present talk. First, toleration is obligatory, not criticism. So do not try to make people critically-minded: do not force them in any way to try to offer or accept criticism, to learn to participate effectively in the game of critical discussion. If they refuse, then they are within their right. Also, they will easily ad vance excuses for their refusal; admittedly some of these are unreasonable, but not all.',

 {'abstract': u'Karl R. Popper is \u201cthe outstanding philosopher of the twentieth century\u201d (Bryan Magee), even \u201cthe greatest thinker of the [twentieth] century\u201d (Gellner). He felt affinity with thinkers of the Age of Reason and developed a new version of rationalism: critical rationalism. As a champion of science and of democracy he was the most influential philosopher of the post-WWII era. He was a close follower of Bertrand Russell and of Albert Einstein in that all three advocated problem-oriented fallibilism (during the peak of the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein who did not), valued commonsense, taking its theories to be approximations to the scientific truths of the day, and considered scientific truths as series of approximations to the absolute truth [Agassi, 1981, 112-16]. In particular, all three viewed science as the bold flight of the imagination checked and tempered by experience [Russell, 1931, 102]; [Einstein, 1949, 680]. Insofar as Russell adumbrated Popper\u2019s philosophy, it may be fair to consider the latter a streamlined version of the former (the way both Berkeley and Hume deemed their philosophies streamlined versions of Locke\u2019s [Hattiangadi, 1985]; [Wettersten, l985]. Russell raised the level of rational discourse in philosophy while remaining within the empiricist tradition; Popper continued and consolidated Russell\u2019s achievements, adding a broad modification of the rationalist tradition [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24], thus forging new ways of philosophizing [Lakatos, 1978, 10]. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between rationalism and irrationalism, between individualism and collectivism, as well as between radicalism and traditionalism. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between empiricism and intellectualism.',

 {'abstract': u'On September 17, 1994, Karl Popper died at the age of 92.He was described as the official opposition of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d, the philosophical club which in the inter-war period was glamorous and which espoused the then popular doctrine of logical positivism, so-called. His relations with that club were friendly-hostile, to use the term with which he liked to characterize the relations between scientific researchers. He is the last of that generation (unless it is Carl G. Hempel, who, however, sees himself as too young to belong there). The public aspect of Popper\u2019s friendly-hostile relations with his Viennese peers was unfortunately more hostile than friendly. Somehow, philosophers have managed to keep the accounts open for too long. The end of the era is the time to close accounts so as to be able to go on with the job at hand, since the intermingling of personal affairs with objective knowledge is unhealthy. Yet most of the leading heirs of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d still coast around the issues raised by Popper, and so they can neither overlook him nor quote him correctly. If past evidence is reliable here, then this will alter just about now. Is it?',

 {'abstract': u"Self- Deception in General &#34;A Liberal Decalogue&#34; suggests (Russell, 1967, pp. 60-61) not to envy people who live in a fool's paradise: It is a place only for fools. This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason. Later on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and even called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to his annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others.

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

({'abstract': u'The following brief study touches upon a very small fraction of the vast anonymous theological literature of modern times. The very concept of anonymity has a diversity of flavors, from the oriental and ancient Western, through the medieval, to the modern: proper anonymity is possible only in a culture where authorship is usually boasted of, and where the mock ascriptions of the kind we find either in the <i>Song of Songs</i> or in the <i>Book of Splendour</i> (vulgarly described as forgeries) is out of the question to the point that it is normally looked upon as a form of forgery. That is to say, properly anonymous books were not written before the scientific revolution. Dating this revolution can be somewhat flexible. Some historians take 1600 or thereabouts as the proper cut-off date, with the burning of Giordano Bruno at the stake as the last act of its kind of flagrant medieval barbarism. Some take it to be the year 1660, the date of the founding of the Royal Society of London and the institution of its standards of scientific protocol \u2013 standards that were adopted as a matter of course by all its daughters.',

 {'abstract': u'<i>The Process of Education</i> was the outcome of the historic Woods Hall Conference of 1959 where ideas were chewed by the cleverest activists Bruner could invite in hopes of planning education anew.

These representatives included two historians as well as scientists, scholars, and educationists, under the distinguished auspices of the U.S. National Academy of Science. Some of the conference participants greatly assisted Bruner in developing this book through their &#34;on the spot&#34; deliberations. The results of these deliberations were summed up in various reports, selections of which are incorporated in <i>The Process of Education</i>.',

 {'abstract': u'The context of a scientific theory can be epistemological and methodological. Or it car be metaphysical, relating to the intellectual framework within which we cast it. Or it can be intertheoretical, both synchronically and diachronically. My concern here will be mainly diachronical -- the historical context of quantum theory, what is required of it vis -a-vis that context and how well it fulfills this requirement. But I shall come to this only at the later part of this essay. I shall have to clear the 3round by discussing the epistemic and metaphysical contexts first.',

 {'abstract': u'The ills of psychiatry are currently diagnoses with the aid of deficient etiologies. The currently proposed prescriptions for psychiatry are practically impossible. The defective part of the profession is its leadership which in its very defensiveness sticks to the status quo, thereby owning the worst defects and impeding all possible cure. The current discussions of the matter are pretentious and thus woolly. The minimal requirement from the profession as a whole and from each of its individual members is that they be not defensive and clear. In this vein I offer here preliminary discussions of propriety, of responsibility and of science.',

Assessments of this revolution were repeatedly invited, particularly by opponent, chiefly from Chicago. F. A. von Hayek has explicitly and bitterly blames Keynes for all our economic troubles; Harry Johnson has repeatedly declared the most revolutionary work of Keynes, his <i>General Theory</i> of 1936, so poor that but for its author's name on its title page it would have totally flopped. Can such a flop cause so much damage? Are these two assessments \u2013 of Hayek and of Johnson \u2013 in conflict or no t? Don Patinkin has raised a different question: how different is Keynes from his Chicago opponents, say, Milton Friedman? How many heads need roll, to use his metaphor, before a revolution may be declared? Patinkin sees Keynes as slightly deviant but stil l a member of the mainstream \u2013 the mainstream of the mainstream being Friedman and his Chicago followers, of course. Now, can a minor deviant be a flop? Can minor deviations from the true blue doctrine be to blame for all of our economic woes? I do not kno w.",

Yet they wear out, some with the first hearing, some with the tenth. To be really both immediately very impressive and very durable, like Debussy's <i>Fetes</i> and Mozart's standard music, is every artist's dream, yet many serious composers prefer the durable over the immediately impressive, and take comfort in the fact that Bach's monumental works, <i>The Art of Fugue. The Musical Offering,</i> the <i>Goldberg Variations,</i>  and the <i>Mass in B Minor,</i> take a lot of sustained effort from their audience, as do most of Beethoven's later compositions, except for his ninth symphony and similar bits.",

 {'abstract': u"The liberal approach to ethics quite naturally tends toward the classic individualistic theory of society, to reductionism or psychologism so-called, that is, to a reduction of all social action to individual action. For example, liberalism allows one to experiment with new medications on one's own body. By extension, liberalism allows one to experiment, it seems, on another person's body with new medication if one acts as the other person's agent, that is, if one has the other person's proper consent. We all know that new medicines are introduced into the market experimentally; indeed, government agencies, such as food and drug administrations, are supposed to supervise such experimentations and eliminate from the market as quickly as possible new (or old) medications that prove harmful. Hence, the very introduction of a new medicine into the market requires the consent of the public - in the form of proper permits to manufacture and market new (and old) drugs and other medications.",

 {'abstract': u'Two suggestions are at the back of the present talk. First, toleration is obligatory, not criticism. So do not try to make people critically-minded: do not force them in any way to try to offer or accept criticism, to learn to participate effectively in the game of critical discussion. If they refuse, then they are within their right. Also, they will easily ad vance excuses for their refusal; admittedly some of these are unreasonable, but not all.',

 {'abstract': u'Karl R. Popper is \u201cthe outstanding philosopher of the twentieth century\u201d (Bryan Magee), even \u201cthe greatest thinker of the [twentieth] century\u201d (Gellner). He felt affinity with thinkers of the Age of Reason and developed a new version of rationalism: critical rationalism. As a champion of science and of democracy he was the most influential philosopher of the post-WWII era. He was a close follower of Bertrand Russell and of Albert Einstein in that all three advocated problem-oriented fallibilism (during the peak of the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein who did not), valued commonsense, taking its theories to be approximations to the scientific truths of the day, and considered scientific truths as series of approximations to the absolute truth [Agassi, 1981, 112-16]. In particular, all three viewed science as the bold flight of the imagination checked and tempered by experience [Russell, 1931, 102]; [Einstein, 1949, 680]. Insofar as Russell adumbrated Popper\u2019s philosophy, it may be fair to consider the latter a streamlined version of the former (the way both Berkeley and Hume deemed their philosophies streamlined versions of Locke\u2019s [Hattiangadi, 1985]; [Wettersten, l985]. Russell raised the level of rational discourse in philosophy while remaining within the empiricist tradition; Popper continued and consolidated Russell\u2019s achievements, adding a broad modification of the rationalist tradition [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24], thus forging new ways of philosophizing [Lakatos, 1978, 10]. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between rationalism and irrationalism, between individualism and collectivism, as well as between radicalism and traditionalism. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between empiricism and intellectualism.',

 {'abstract': u'On September 17, 1994, Karl Popper died at the age of 92.He was described as the official opposition of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d, the philosophical club which in the inter-war period was glamorous and which espoused the then popular doctrine of logical positivism, so-called. His relations with that club were friendly-hostile, to use the term with which he liked to characterize the relations between scientific researchers. He is the last of that generation (unless it is Carl G. Hempel, who, however, sees himself as too young to belong there). The public aspect of Popper\u2019s friendly-hostile relations with his Viennese peers was unfortunately more hostile than friendly. Somehow, philosophers have managed to keep the accounts open for too long. The end of the era is the time to close accounts so as to be able to go on with the job at hand, since the intermingling of personal affairs with objective knowledge is unhealthy. Yet most of the leading heirs of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d still coast around the issues raised by Popper, and so they can neither overlook him nor quote him correctly. If past evidence is reliable here, then this will alter just about now. Is it?',

A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason. Later on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and even called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to his annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

 {'abstract': u"The variety of languages in the world is considered a curse by some, who view the phenomenon as a Tower of Babel. Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

 {'abstract': u"The word &#34;brain-washing&#34;, translated from Chinese communist jargon, is a very strong metaphor, first popularized by Robert Jay Lifto n. It vividly describes one person interfering with the personality make-up of another, removing the other's ideology and replacing it, and similarly tampering with the other's tastes, pool of information to rely upon and whatever else goes into the make-up of the other's personality. Clearly, in some sense or another everyone interferes with the personality of people with whom they interact; yet what is meant here is something much more drastic than friends influencing one another's tastes or opinions; it is something more dramatic and more large scale.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

({'abstract': u'The following brief study touches upon a very small fraction of the vast anonymous theological literature of modern times. The very concept of anonymity has a diversity of flavors, from the oriental and ancient Western, through the medieval, to the modern: proper anonymity is possible only in a culture where authorship is usually boasted of, and where the mock ascriptions of the kind we find either in the <i>Song of Songs</i> or in the <i>Book of Splendour</i> (vulgarly described as forgeries) is out of the question to the point that it is normally looked upon as a form of forgery. That is to say, properly anonymous books were not written before the scientific revolution. Dating this revolution can be somewhat flexible. Some historians take 1600 or thereabouts as the proper cut-off date, with the burning of Giordano Bruno at the stake as the last act of its kind of flagrant medieval barbarism. Some take it to be the year 1660, the date of the founding of the Royal Society of London and the institution of its standards of scientific protocol \u2013 standards that were adopted as a matter of course by all its daughters.',

 {'abstract': u'<i>The Process of Education</i> was the outcome of the historic Woods Hall Conference of 1959 where ideas were chewed by the cleverest activists Bruner could invite in hopes of planning education anew. The conference, headed by Bruner, consisted of thirty-five participants who served as distinguished representatives of lustrous new educational experiments. These representatives included two historians as well as scientists, scholars, and educationists, under the distinguished auspices of the U.S. National Academy of Science. Some of the conference participants greatly assisted Bruner in developing this book through their &#34;on the spot&#34; deliberations. The results of these deliberations were summed up in various reports, selections of which are incorporated in <i>The Process of Education</i>.',

Or it can be intertheoretical, both synchronically and diachronically. My concern here will be mainly diachronical -- the historical context of quantum theory, what is required of it vis -a-vis that context and how well it fulfills this requirement. But I shall come to this only at the later part of this essay. I shall have to clear the 3round by discussing the epistemic and metaphysical contexts first.',

 {'abstract': u'The ills of psychiatry are currently diagnoses with the aid of deficient etiologies. The currently proposed prescriptions for psychiatry are practically impossible. The defective part of the profession is its leadership which in its very defensiveness sticks to the status quo, thereby owning the worst defects and impeding all possible cure. The current discussions of the matter are pretentious and thus woolly. The minimal requirement from the profession as a whole and from each of its individual members is that they be not defensive and clear. In this vein I offer here preliminary discussions of propriety, of responsibility and of science.',

Yet they wear out, some with the first hearing, some with the tenth. To be really both immediately very impressive and very durable, like Debussy's <i>Fetes</i> and Mozart's standard music, is every artist's dream, yet many serious composers prefer the durable over the immediately impressive, and take comfort in the fact that Bach's monumental works, <i>The Art of Fugue. The Musical Offering,</i> the <i>Goldberg Variations,</i>  and the <i>Mass in B Minor,</i> take a lot of sustained effort from their audience, as do most of Beethoven's later compositions, except for his ninth symphony and similar bits.",

 {'abstract': u"The liberal approach to ethics quite naturally tends toward the classic individualistic theory of society, to reductionism or psychologism so-called, that is, to a reduction of all social action to individual action. For example, liberalism allows one to experiment with new medications on one's own body. By extension, liberalism allows one to experiment, it seems, on another person's body with new medication if one acts as the other person's agent, that is, if one has the other person's proper consent. We all know that new medicines are introduced into the market experimentally; indeed, government agencies, such as food and drug administrations, are supposed to supervise such experimentations and eliminate from the market as quickly as possible new (or old) medications that prove harmful. Hence, the very introduction of a new medicine into the market requires the consent of the public - in the form of proper permits to manufacture and market new (and old) drugs and other medications.",

 {'abstract': u'Two suggestions are at the back of the present talk. First, toleration is obligatory, not criticism. So do not try to make people critically-minded: do not force them in any way to try to offer or accept criticism, to learn to participate effectively in the game of critical discussion. If they refuse, then they are within their right. Also, they will easily ad vance excuses for their refusal; admittedly some of these are unreasonable, but not all.',

 {'abstract': u'Karl R. Popper is \u201cthe outstanding philosopher of the twentieth century\u201d (Bryan Magee), even \u201cthe greatest thinker of the [twentieth] century\u201d (Gellner). He felt affinity with thinkers of the Age of Reason and developed a new version of rationalism: critical rationalism. As a champion of science and of democracy he was the most influential philosopher of the post-WWII era. He was a close follower of Bertrand Russell and of Albert Einstein in that all three advocated problem-oriented fallibilism (during the peak of the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein who did not), valued commonsense, taking its theories to be approximations to the scientific truths of the day, and considered scientific truths as series of approximations to the absolute truth [Agassi, 1981, 112-16]. In particular, all three viewed science as the bold flight of the imagination checked and tempered by experience [Russell, 1931, 102]; [Einstein, 1949, 680]. Insofar as Russell adumbrated Popper\u2019s philosophy, it may be fair to consider the latter a streamlined version of the former (the way both Berkeley and Hume deemed their philosophies streamlined versions of Locke\u2019s [Hattiangadi, 1985]; [Wettersten, l985]. Russell raised the level of rational discourse in philosophy while remaining within the empiricist tradition; Popper continued and consolidated Russell\u2019s achievements, adding a broad modification of the rationalist tradition [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24], thus forging new ways of philosophizing [Lakatos, 1978, 10]. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between rationalism and irrationalism, between individualism and collectivism, as well as between radicalism and traditionalism. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between empiricism and intellectualism.',

 {'abstract': u'On September 17, 1994, Karl Popper died at the age of 92.He was described as the official opposition of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d, the philosophical club which in the inter-war period was glamorous and which espoused the then popular doctrine of logical positivism, so-called. His relations with that club were friendly-hostile, to use the term with which he liked to characterize the relations between scientific researchers. He is the last of that generation (unless it is Carl G. Hempel, who, however, sees himself as too young to belong there). The public aspect of Popper\u2019s friendly-hostile relations with his Viennese peers was unfortunately more hostile than friendly. Somehow, philosophers have managed to keep the accounts open for too long. The end of the era is the time to close accounts so as to be able to go on with the job at hand, since the intermingling of personal affairs with objective knowledge is unhealthy. Yet most of the leading heirs of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d still coast around the issues raised by Popper, and so they can neither overlook him nor quote him correctly. If past evidence is reliable here, then this will alter just about now. Is it?',

 {'abstract': u"Self- Deception in General &#34;A Liberal Decalogue&#34; suggests (Russell, 1967, pp. 60-61) not to envy people who live in a fool's paradise: It is a place only for fools. This saying invites detailed commentary. A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively. They would not easily fa ll for the reassuring hypothesis, preferring to examine any reasonable alternative hypothesis about any risk that might invite action - - so that if the hypothesis is corroborated they can try to mobilize some appropriate action.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl Popper discussed admirably the choice between faith and reason [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24]. He admitted that the basis of rationalism is a faith of sorts, a faith in reason. Later on his disciple William W. Bartley dissented from him [Bartley, 1962] and even called him a fideist [Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, 205, 208, 210-11], much to his annoyance. All this caused bad blood between the two [Lakatos and Musgrave, 1968, 89, 114], which is most regrettable. It is understandable, though, as the matter is very complicated. Let me show this now.',

Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',

({'abstract': u'The following brief study touches upon a very small fraction of the vast anonymous theological literature of modern times. The very concept of anonymity has a diversity of flavors, from the oriental and ancient Western, through the medieval, to the modern: proper anonymity is possible only in a culture where authorship is usually boasted of, and where the mock ascriptions of the kind we find either in the <i>Song of Songs</i> or in the <i>Book of Splendour</i> (vulgarly described as forgeries) is out of the question to the point that it is normally looked upon as a form of forgery. That is to say, properly anonymous books were not written before the scientific revolution. Dating this revolution can be somewhat flexible. Some historians take 1600 or thereabouts as the proper cut-off date, with the burning of Giordano Bruno at the stake as the last act of its kind of flagrant medieval barbarism. Some take it to be the year 1660, the date of the founding of the Royal Society of London and the institution of its standards of scientific protocol \u2013 standards that were adopted as a matter of course by all its daughters.',

 {'abstract': u'<i>The Process of Education</i> was the outcome of the historic Woods Hall Conference of 1959 where ideas were chewed by the cleverest activists Bruner could invite in hopes of planning education anew. The conference, headed by Bruner, consisted of thirty-five participants who served as distinguished representatives of lustrous new educational experiments. These representatives included two historians as well as scientists, scholars, and educationists, under the distinguished auspices of the U.S. National Academy of Science. Some of the conference participants greatly assisted Bruner in developing this book through their &#34;on the spot&#34; deliberations. The results of these deliberations were summed up in various reports, selections of which are incorporated in <i>The Process of Education</i>.',

 {'abstract': u'The ills of psychiatry are currently diagnoses with the aid of deficient etiologies. The currently proposed prescriptions for psychiatry are practically impossible. The defective part of the profession is its leadership which in its very defensiveness sticks to the status quo, thereby owning the worst defects and impeding all possible cure. The current discussions of the matter are pretentious and thus woolly. The minimal requirement from the profession as a whole and from each of its individual members is that they be not defensive and clear. In this vein I offer here preliminary discussions of propriety, of responsibility and of science.',

They all strike their new listener very forcefully; indeed, if you can find music lovers who have not heard one of these you can easily move them to tears by a good performance. Yet they wear out, some with the first hearing, some with the tenth. To be really both immediately very impressive and very durable, like Debussy's <i>Fetes</i> and Mozart's standard music, is every artist's dream, yet many serious composers prefer the durable over the immediately impressive, and take comfort in the fact that Bach's monumental works, <i>The Art of Fugue. The Musical Offering,</i> the <i>Goldberg Variations,</i>  and the <i>Mass in B Minor,</i> take a lot of sustained effort from their audience, as do most of Beethoven's later compositions, except for his ninth symphony and similar bits.",

 {'abstract': u"The liberal approach to ethics quite naturally tends toward the classic individualistic theory of society, to reductionism or psychologism so-called, that is, to a reduction of all social action to individual action. For example, liberalism allows one to experiment with new medications on one's own body. By extension, liberalism allows one to experiment, it seems, on another person's body with new medication if one acts as the other person's agent, that is, if one has the other person's proper consent. We all know that new medicines are introduced into the market experimentally; indeed, government agencies, such as food and drug administrations, are supposed to supervise such experimentations and eliminate from the market as quickly as possible new (or old) medications that prove harmful. Hence, the very introduction of a new medicine into the market requires the consent of the public - in the form of proper permits to manufacture and market new (and old) drugs and other medications.",

 {'abstract': u'Karl R. Popper is \u201cthe outstanding philosopher of the twentieth century\u201d (Bryan Magee), even \u201cthe greatest thinker of the [twentieth] century\u201d (Gellner). He felt affinity with thinkers of the Age of Reason and developed a new version of rationalism: critical rationalism. As a champion of science and of democracy he was the most influential philosopher of the post-WWII era. He was a close follower of Bertrand Russell and of Albert Einstein in that all three advocated problem-oriented fallibilism (during the peak of the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein who did not), valued commonsense, taking its theories to be approximations to the scientific truths of the day, and considered scientific truths as series of approximations to the absolute truth [Agassi, 1981, 112-16]. In particular, all three viewed science as the bold flight of the imagination checked and tempered by experience [Russell, 1931, 102]; [Einstein, 1949, 680]. Insofar as Russell adumbrated Popper\u2019s philosophy, it may be fair to consider the latter a streamlined version of the former (the way both Berkeley and Hume deemed their philosophies streamlined versions of Locke\u2019s [Hattiangadi, 1985]; [Wettersten, l985]. Russell raised the level of rational discourse in philosophy while remaining within the empiricist tradition; Popper continued and consolidated Russell\u2019s achievements, adding a broad modification of the rationalist tradition [Popper, 1945, Ch. 24], thus forging new ways of philosophizing [Lakatos, 1978, 10]. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between rationalism and irrationalism, between individualism and collectivism, as well as between radicalism and traditionalism. Many sought a <i>via media</i> between empiricism and intellectualism.',

 {'abstract': u'On September 17, 1994, Karl Popper died at the age of 92.He was described as the official opposition of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d, the philosophical club which in the inter-war period was glamorous and which espoused the then popular doctrine of logical positivism, so-called. His relations with that club were friendly-hostile, to use the term with which he liked to characterize the relations between scientific researchers. He is the last of that generation (unless it is Carl G. Hempel, who, however, sees himself as too young to belong there). The public aspect of Popper\u2019s friendly-hostile relations with his Viennese peers was unfortunately more hostile than friendly. Somehow, philosophers have managed to keep the accounts open for too long. The end of the era is the time to close accounts so as to be able to go on with the job at hand, since the intermingling of personal affairs with objective knowledge is unhealthy. Yet most of the leading heirs of the \u201c Vienna Circle\u201d still coast around the issues raised by Popper, and so they can neither overlook him nor quote him correctly. If past evidence is reliable here, then this will alter just about now. Is it?',

A fool's paradise is not a place, but a state o f mind; it is a system of opinions, of assessments of situations, that calms one down, that reassures one into the opinion that all is well, even when all is far from well. Fools may be ignorant of the severity of their situations, perhaps because being well informed tends to get them into a panic. This happens regularly, and there is little that can be done about it, except that the wise would still prefer to be well informed so as to try to cope with the panic more constructively.

 {'abstract': u"The variety of languages in the world is considered a curse by some, who view the phenomenon as a Tower of Babel. Others consider it the most characteristic quality of human language as opposed to animal languages, which are supposedly species specific. The variety is viewed as a symptom of human caprice, arbitrariness, or dependence on mere historical accident by some; and as a symptom of human freedom and of the creative aspect of language by others. And, of course, the human limitation caused by the variety of languages and the peculiarities of traditions within languages, as instanced by Sir Winston Churchill's The History of the English Speaking People, are again viewed by different thinkers from different philosophical viewpoints.",

 {'abstract': u"The word &#34;brain-washing&#34;, translated from Chinese communist jargon, is a very strong metaphor, first popularized by Robert Jay Lifto n. It vividly describes one person interfering with the personality make-up of another, removing the other's ideology and replacing it, and similarly tampering with the other's tastes, pool of information to rely upon and whatever else goes into the make-up of the other's personality. Clearly, in some sense or another everyone interferes with the personality of people with whom they interact; yet what is meant here is something much more drastic than friends influencing one another's tastes or opinions; it is something more dramatic and more large scale.",

 {'abstract': u'ANTHROPOMORPHISM is an inveterate tendency to project human qualities into natural phenomena\u2014consciously or not. The standard and most important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually neglected logical aspects of the idea. First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we <i>know</i> of human beings, but what we <i>assume</i> to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls. At the very least, we may leave the question, \u201cDo human souls exist?\u201d open, and still speak of animism as based on an analogy\u2014not so much from known human qualities to unknown natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.',
