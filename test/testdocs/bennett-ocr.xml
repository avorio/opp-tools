<text top="235" left="514" width="159" height="17" font="1">Jonathan Bennett</text>
<text top="326" left="92" width="475" height="15" font="1">Philosophers can be known for their doctrines and their</text>
<text top="347" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="1">arguments for them, or for their methods. <strong>I</strong> am much</text>
<text top="368" left="92" width="475" height="15" font="1">less famous than some of the contributors to this book,</text>
<text top="388" left="91" width="475" height="15" font="1">but insofar as <strong>I</strong> am known it is for methods rather than</text>
<text top="409" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="1">for doctrines. <strong>I</strong> shall describe how I have approached five</text>
<text top="430" left="92" width="476" height="15" font="1">different regions of philosophy. These regions contain all of</text>
<text top="450" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="1">my eight books, and more than seventy of the ninety articles</text>
<text top="471" left="92" width="476" height="18" font="1">that I have published so far. [T he others are on a variety of</text>
<text top="492" left="92" width="291" height="18" font="1">topics which I cannot describe here.)</text>
<text top="540" left="92" width="234" height="16" font="1">Early modern philosophy</text>
<text top="574" left="92" width="477" height="15" font="1">European—centered philosophy, and especially English—</text>
<text top="595" left="92" width="475" height="15" font="1">language philosophy, has been strongly influenced by early</text>
<text top="615" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="1">modern philosophy, the most prominent figures in which</text>
<text top="636" left="90" width="477" height="15" font="1">were Descartes, Spinoza and Locke in the 17th century,</text>
<text top="657" left="92" width="475" height="15" font="1">Leibniz later in that century and carrying on into the 18th,</text>
<text top="677" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="1">and Berkeley, Hume and Kant in the 18th century. <strong>A</strong> great</text>
<text top="698" left="92" width="475" height="15" font="1">deal of my work has been concerned with those philosophers:</text>
<text top="719" left="92" width="475" height="15" font="1">I have published four books and nearly thirty articles on early</text>
<text top="739" left="92" width="476" height="15" font="1">modern philosophy, and two more books are in preparation.</text>
<text top="760" left="90" width="476" height="15" font="1">This part of my work is controversial: some philosophers</text>
<text top="781" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="1">like my approach to early modern philosophy and have been</text>
<text top="801" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="1">helped by it to find their own way into this area; others</text>
<text top="326" left="621" width="475" height="15" font="2">criticize it, sometimes expressing not merely disagreement</text>
<text top="347" left="619" width="372" height="15" font="2">with my approach but passionate hatred for it.</text>
<text top="368" left="646" width="449" height="15" font="2">I confront the great philosophers of the early modern</text>
<text top="388" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="2">period as I would my own contemporaries: I treat them as</text>
<text top="409" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="2">real philosophers with whom I can enter into discussion and</text>
<text top="430" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="2">argument, and I do this with a view to making progress in</text>
<text top="450" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="2">my own philosophical thinking. For me the study of early</text>
<text top="471" left="620" width="476" height="15" font="2">modern philosophy is philosophy with a special technique,</text>
<text top="492" left="620" width="325" height="15" font="2">not history with a special subject matter.</text>
<text top="512" left="646" width="451" height="15" font="2">Some philosophers these days hold that this is an ineffi—</text>
<text top="533" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="2">cient way of doing philosophy: so much has been learned in</text>
<text top="554" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="2">the past few centuries, they say, that we would do better to</text>
<text top="574" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="2">read our own contemporaries, who stand on the shoulders</text>
<text top="595" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="2">of the great philosophers of the past. That might be right if I</text>
<text top="615" left="619" width="476" height="15" font="2">were looking to the early modern philosophers for a hand—out</text>
<text top="636" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="2">of valid arguments, true doctrines, and correct solutions to</text>
<text top="657" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="2">problems; but that is not howl expect them to help me. I can</text>
<text top="677" left="620" width="476" height="15" font="2">learn as much from their failures as from their successes:</text>
<text top="698" left="619" width="476" height="15" font="2">when a superb philosopher tackles the hardest problems in</text>
<text top="718" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="2">a manner that is bold, resolute and highly intelligent, there</text>
<text top="739" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="2">is much to be learned from how he goes about it, even if he</text>
<text top="760" left="620" width="189" height="15" font="2">gets most things wrong.</text>
<text top="781" left="646" width="449" height="15" font="2">Some of those who devalue this technique for advancing</text>

<text top="301" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0"><strong>I</strong> do not want to join them in doing it. Real philosophy is</text>
<text top="322" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">much more challenging, difficult and interesting than the</text>
<text top="343" left="92" width="252" height="15" font="0">antiquarian study of its history.</text>
<text top="366" left="117" width="449" height="15" font="0">Some philosophically motivated workers on early modern</text>

<text top="510" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">facts about the controversies in which he was engaged, facts</text>
<text top="531" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">about his personal life, and so on. There is a vast amount</text>
<text top="551" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">of scholarly work that can be done, and some of it may help</text>
<text top="572" left="90" width="476" height="15" font="0">with the central task of understanding the thought of the</text>

<text top="719" left="92" width="475" height="15" font="0">understanding of a text because one has not thought about it</text>
<text top="739" left="92" width="476" height="15" font="0">hard enough and long enough, has not read it often enough,</text>

<text top="157" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="0">and so on. Those who make the other choice—attending</text>
<text top="177" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="0">more to the periphery, at the expense of the center—produce</text>
<text top="198" left="620" width="476" height="15" font="0">results that strike me as philosophically thin and superficial,</text>
<text top="219" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="0">not capturing the tough complex core of the great early</text>
<text top="239" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="0">modern philosophers. To get at that core one must engage</text>
<text top="260" left="619" width="476" height="15" font="0">with the philosopher in question as a colleague, as a living</text>
<text top="281" left="621" width="476" height="15" font="0">struggling thinker with whom one can argue about the issues,</text>
<text top="301" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="0">rather than as a fragile historical object who is interesting</text>
<text top="322" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="0">mainly for his place in history and the facts about whom</text>
<text top="343" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="0">he influenced and who influenced him. The ‘scholarly’ early</text>
<text top="363" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="0">modernists find my work irresponsible; I find most of theirs</text>

<text top="430" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="0">early modern philosophy in the way I do. My philosophical</text>
<text top="451" left="621" width="475" height="15" font="0">studies through M.A. were done in a one—man department</text>
<text top="471" left="620" width="476" height="15" font="0">in New Zealand. The one man was the late Arthur N. Prior:</text>
<text top="492" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="0">he was a wonderful teacher and an even better role model;</text>
<text top="513" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="0">I loved him, and revere his memory. However, he was so</text>
<text top="533" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="0">overworked that he did not have time to learn very much;</text>
<text top="554" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="0">and when I left New Zealand to undertake graduate studies</text>
<text top="574" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="0">I knew little of philosophy or its history. I did my graduate</text>
<text top="595" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="0">studies in 1953—5 at the University of Oxford, which I enjoyed</text>
<text top="615" left="621" width="474" height="19" font="0">and to which I am grateful. I learned much from Quine</text>
<text top="636" left="621" width="475" height="18" font="1">(who was there as a visitor), Waismann, Price, Dummett,</text>
<text top="657" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="0">Hampshire, Grice, and a few others; but I had no teachers</text>
<text top="677" left="619" width="475" height="15" font="0">whose job it was to educate me in a systematic way, and</text>
<text top="698" left="621" width="477" height="15" font="0">at the end of those two years I was still very ignorant.</text>
<text top="719" left="619" width="476" height="15" font="0">Then after one year of teaching in the USA I began twelve</text>
<text top="739" left="619" width="476" height="15" font="0">years in Cambridge, where my main work was to lecture on</text>
<text top="760" left="621" width="476" height="15" font="0">early modern philosophy. To a large extent I taught myself</text>
<text top="781" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="0">philosophy through wrestling with those texts; and that is</text>

<text top="367" left="92" width="476" height="15" font="0">part of philosophy is a little peculiar. <strong>I</strong> shall try to explain it.</text>
<text top="389" left="117" width="449" height="15" font="0">Over the past thirty years, English—language philosophers</text>

<text top="492" left="92" width="476" height="15" font="0">a good philosophical question arises: What is the role of</text>

<text top="533" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">in describing an animal’s mind? What are we doing when</text>

<text top="615" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">says the following. Beliefs and desires are best understood</text>
<text top="636" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">in terms of their roles in explaining behavior. When we</text>
<text top="657" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">have the facts about how an animal moves in relation to</text>

<text top="698" left="92" width="475" height="15" font="0">perceived by the animal, we have a chance of forming a</text>
<text top="719" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">theory that will help us to predict further facts about how it</text>

<text top="157" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">some success as a topic of discussion in graduate student</text>
<text top="177" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">seminars, and <strong>I</strong> think it had some influence in turning</text>
<text top="198" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">people’s thoughts towards that kind of question and thus</text>
<text top="219" left="92" width="464" height="15" font="0">helping to launch the movement that led to functionalism.</text>
<text top="241" left="116" width="451" height="15" font="0">About twelve years later <strong>I</strong> produced another, longer book</text>
<text top="262" left="90" width="478" height="15" font="0">which was partly a contribution to the philosophy of mind.</text>
<text top="282" left="92" width="476" height="15" font="0"><strong>It</strong> began as an exploration of an analysis of the concept of</text>
<text top="303" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">meaning, by the late Paul Grice. What is it for someone to</text>
<text top="324" left="92" width="475" height="18" font="0">utter a sound (or write a mark, or make a gesture) thereby</text>
<text top="344" left="92" width="475" height="15" font="0">meaning that such and such is the case? Grice rightly</text>
<text top="365" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">distinguished ‘natural’ meaning, which is involved when we</text>
<text top="385" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">say ‘Those clouds mean that there will be rain’ from the</text>
<text top="406" left="91" width="475" height="18" font="0">‘non—natural’ kind of meaning that words have. <strong>[I</strong> do not</text>
<text top="426" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">know whether any Chinese language contains anything like</text>
<text top="447" left="92" width="474" height="18" font="0">this ambiguity in the verb ‘to mean’.) Grice’s concern was</text>
<text top="468" left="90" width="476" height="15" font="0">with non—natural meaning, which he sought to explain in</text>
<text top="488" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">terms of intention. Here is an idea that has appealed to</text>
<text top="509" left="92" width="216" height="15" font="0">many theorists of meaning:</text>
<text top="532" left="143" width="423" height="15" font="0">To say ‘When he pointed towards the door he meant</text>
<text top="552" left="144" width="422" height="15" font="0">that his wife was to leave the room’ is to say that in</text>
<text top="573" left="144" width="422" height="15" font="0">making his gesture he intended to get his wife to leave</text>
<text top="594" left="144" width="422" height="15" font="0">the room; and to say ‘When he placed his hands on</text>
<text top="614" left="144" width="422" height="15" font="0">his cheeks he meant that he was sorry’ is to say that</text>
<text top="635" left="144" width="421" height="15" font="0">in making that gesture he intended his audience to</text>
<text top="655" left="144" width="190" height="15" font="0">think that he was sorry.</text>
<text top="677" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">Perhaps meaning is conected with intending to affect the</text>
<text top="698" left="91" width="474" height="15" font="0">behavior and beliefs of others, but the connection cannot be</text>
<text top="719" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">as simple as that. There are many ways in which someone</text>
<text top="739" left="92" width="475" height="15" font="0">might act, intending to get his wife to leave the room, that</text>
<text top="760" left="92" width="475" height="15" font="0">nobody would describe as his uttering something meaning</text>
<text top="781" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">that she was to leave the room. For example, if he starts</text>
<text top="801" left="92" width="475" height="15" font="0">making a loud noise which he knows she will want to get</text>
<text top="198" left="620" width="164" height="15" font="0">be right as it stands.</text>
<text top="717" left="620" width="182" height="15" font="0">the following objection:</text>
<text top="56" left="950" width="145" height="15" font="0">Jonathan Bennett</text>
<text top="116" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="0">away from, he may do this intending to get her to leave</text>
<text top="136" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="0">the room; but this behaviour of his will not be anything like</text>
<text top="157" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="0">uttering a command; it will not be an instance of non—natural</text>
<text top="177" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="0">meaning. So the above suggested account of meaning cannot</text>
<text top="220" left="645" width="450" height="15" font="0">That much was common knowledge when, in 1957, Grice</text>
<text top="241" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="0">offered a refinement of the above suggested analysis of the</text>
<text top="261" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="0">concept of non—natural meaning. He argued that non—natural</text>
<text top="282" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="0">meaning is intending to affect in <em>a</em> certain <em>way</em> the behaviour</text>
<text top="302" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="0">or beliefs of others; the ‘way’ in question fits the gesure</text>
<text top="323" left="621" width="475" height="15" font="0">of pointing to the door and does not fit the making of a</text>
<text top="344" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="0">disagreeable noise. I cannot go into the details of it here; I</text>
<text top="364" left="621" width="475" height="15" font="0">can only report that I am one of many philosophers who think</text>
<text top="385" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="0">that this ingenious work of Grice’s constituted a fundamental</text>
<text top="406" left="621" width="456" height="15" font="0">advance in our understanding of the concept of meaning.</text>
<text top="428" left="646" width="450" height="15" font="0"><strong>In</strong> the middle of the 1970s I wrote a book called Linguistic</text>
<text top="448" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="0">Behaviour, basing it on Grice’s work. <strong>In</strong> it I tried to defend</text>
<text top="469" left="621" width="475" height="15" font="0">Grice’s analysis against various criticisms which I thought</text>
<text top="489" left="619" width="477" height="15" font="0">wrong, and to improve it in certain ways so as to meet other</text>
<text top="510" left="621" width="475" height="15" font="0">criticisms which I thought to be right. The second half of that</text>
<text top="531" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="0">book was a success, I still believe, though I doubt if it has</text>
<text top="551" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="0">had much influence, partly because the whole topic became</text>
<text top="572" left="620" width="477" height="15" font="0">unfashionable at about the time the book was published.</text>
<text top="592" left="619" width="476" height="15" font="0">The first half of the book was a sort of contribution to the</text>
<text top="613" left="620" width="427" height="15" font="0">literature of functionalism. <strong>It</strong> came about in this way.</text>
<text top="635" left="645" width="451" height="15" font="0">When I expounded Grice’s ideas to students, I would say</text>
<text top="655" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="0">that his analysis of meaning gives us a better hold on the</text>
<text top="676" left="621" width="475" height="15" font="0">concept of meaning, which we can then use to get a better</text>
<text top="697" left="620" width="475" height="19" font="0">hold on the concept of language. Quite often I was met with</text>
<text top="739" left="673" width="421" height="15" font="0">‘That whole procedure is circular. You are trying to</text>
<text top="760" left="673" width="421" height="15" font="0">clarify language with help from meaning, which you</text>

<text top="240" left="90" width="476" height="15" font="0">This is wrong. <strong>I</strong> believed then and still do believe that we can</text>

<text top="554" left="92" width="475" height="15" font="0">Elizabeth Anscombe gave a speech in defence of the validity</text>
<text top="574" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">of absolutist moral principles, that is, ones of the form ‘It</text>

<text top="636" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">Some people, she said, have criticised such principles on</text>

<text top="509" left="621" width="265" height="15" font="0">about through such a movement.</text>
<text top="613" left="621" width="249" height="15" font="0">Consider these two statements:</text>

<text top="137" left="645" width="453" height="15" font="0">There is a problem about dividing actions from conse—</text>
<text top="158" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="0">quences. When we ask ‘What did he do?’ or ‘What action</text>
<text top="179" left="621" width="475" height="15" font="0">did he perform?’, the answer might be ‘He moved his foot</text>
<text top="199" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="0">like this’ or ‘He dislodged a rock on the bank of the river’ or</text>
<text top="220" left="619" width="475" height="15" font="0">‘He started a slide of rocks into the river’ or ‘He diverted the</text>

<text top="261" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="0">being flooded’; and each of these might correctly describe</text>
<text top="282" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="0">the same behaviour. His ‘basic’ action, one might say, was</text>
<text top="302" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="0">the movement of his foot; all the rest were consequences</text>
<text top="323" left="621" width="476" height="15" font="0">of that; but we can report them without speaking overtly of</text>
<text top="344" left="619" width="477" height="15" font="0">‘consequences’, instead giving suitably enriched accounts of</text>
<text top="364" left="619" width="475" height="15" font="0">‘what he did’. I know this to be true of the English language</text>
<text top="385" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="0">and of many other European languages; I confidently expect</text>
<text top="406" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="0">that it holds for all natural languages, because it reflects</text>
<text top="426" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="0">such a deep human need. We are seldom interested in the</text>
<text top="447" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="0">basic fact about how someone behaved—that is, in the fact</text>
<text top="468" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="0">about how he moved his limbs or his tongue—but we often</text>
<text top="488" left="621" width="475" height="15" font="0">care about what consequential state of affairs he brought</text>
<text top="531" left="646" width="449" height="15" font="0">Now, that does not rule out such absolutist principles</text>
<text top="551" left="621" width="475" height="15" font="0">as ‘It would absolutely always be wrong to kill an innocent</text>

<text top="260" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">depth into the difference between making something happen</text>

<text top="384" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">moral significance at all. That does not immediately refute</text>
<text top="405" left="92" width="188" height="15" font="0">the absolutist principle:</text>

<text top="196" left="620" width="476" height="15" font="0">use this concept a lot: we speak of storms, earthquakes,</text>

<text top="299" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="0">has grown up a considerable interest in understanding what</text>

<text top="341" left="620" width="477" height="15" font="0">fits in with the rest of our system of thought about the world.</text>
<text top="361" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="0">Much of the work in this area has been organized around a</text>
<text top="382" left="620" width="396" height="15" font="0">big division of opinion which I shall now describe.</text>

<text top="468" left="620" width="477" height="15" font="0">for two different expressions to refer to the very same event.</text>
<text top="488" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="0">Davidson rejected Kim’s views about the semantics of event</text>
<text top="509" left="620" width="476" height="15" font="0">names, but offered no alternative to his metaphysic of events,</text>
<text top="530" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="0">that is, his account of what events are. <strong>In</strong> my book Events</text>
<text top="550" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="0">and their Names I argue that Kim is right in his metaphysics</text>
<text top="571" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="0">and Davidson is right in his semantics: the source of the</text>

<text top="633" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="0">invalid, and explain the underlying error which prevented</text>

<text top="327" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="2">conclusions. The first concerns a range of philosophical</text>
<text top="347" left="620" width="476" height="15" font="2">issues that supposedly concern the nature of events as such,</text>
<text top="368" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="2">i.e. the metaphysics of events: Are there any instantaneous</text>
<text top="389" left="621" width="475" height="15" font="2">events, as distinct from ones that take up a period of time?</text>
<text top="409" left="621" width="475" height="15" font="2">Can two events occur in the same place at the same time?</text>
<text top="430" left="621" width="475" height="15" font="2">Could an event have occurred in a different place, or at a</text>
<text top="451" left="621" width="475" height="15" font="2">different time, from the one at which it actually occurred?</text>
<text top="471" left="619" width="476" height="15" font="2">What does it take for two events to be parts of a single</text>
<text top="492" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="2">larger event? These and other comparable questions have</text>
<text top="513" left="620" width="476" height="15" font="2">been debated in the philosophical literature, and I now</text>
<text top="533" left="620" width="477" height="15" font="2">think that most of this debate has been a waste of time.</text>
<text top="554" left="619" width="476" height="15" font="2">Although the questions are posed as though they concerned</text>
<text top="574" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="2">the nature of events (metaphysics), really they only concern</text>
<text top="595" left="620" width="477" height="18" font="2">the language in which we talk about events (semantics).</text>
<text top="615" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="2">Consider for example the questions about whether a given</text>
<text top="636" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="2">aggregate of tropes constitutes one event or several. Was</text>
<text top="657" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="2">the battle which raged on Tuesday the same battle that</text>

<text top="719" left="621" width="475" height="15" font="2">on Monday? We answer such questions by consulting our</text>
<text top="739" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="2">semantic conventions governing phrases like ‘same fire’ and</text>

<text top="781" left="620" width="476" height="15" font="2">there was a continuous fire linking the two; but we allow</text>

<text top="302" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">asking how events in the brain relate to events in the mind;</text>

<text top="385" left="92" width="475" height="15" font="0">that this is because of their use of the event concept. In my</text>
<text top="405" left="91" width="475" height="15" font="0">book <strong>I</strong> argue that our event concept is not sharp—edged or</text>

<text top="446" left="92" width="250" height="15" font="0">my second negative conclusion.</text>
<text top="468" left="116" width="450" height="15" font="0">The third is that the event concept—though quite useful</text>
<text top="488" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">for giving small, vague pieces of information—is one that we</text>
<text top="509" left="92" width="475" height="15" font="0">do not seriously need. We can say that some people fought</text>
<text top="530" left="92" width="475" height="19" font="0">rather than that there was a fight, that rain fell and winds</text>

<text top="592" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">and so on. Virtually all our uses of the event concept can</text>
<text top="612" left="92" width="474" height="15" font="0">easily be replaced by forms of speech in which that concept</text>

<text top="136" left="620" width="476" height="15" font="2">the Chinese languages too, we have two different kinds of</text>
<text top="157" left="621" width="475" height="15" font="2">conditional, of which I shall give examples. Suppose that</text>
<text top="177" left="619" width="475" height="15" font="2">you hire me to mend the roof of your house while you are</text>
<text top="198" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="2">away on a visit to another city; when you return, the roof is</text>
<text top="219" left="620" width="386" height="15" font="2">mended; so you have good reason to accept this:</text>
<text top="240" left="649" width="446" height="17" font="2">(1) <strong>If</strong> Bennett didn’t mend the roof my house, someone</text>
<text top="282" left="620" width="345" height="15" font="2">But you may have no reason to accept this:</text>
<text top="304" left="649" width="447" height="17" font="2">(2) <strong>If</strong> Bennett had not mended the roof of my house,</text>
<text top="347" left="619" width="475" height="17" font="2">You would accept (2) only if you believed that I had made</text>
<text top="367" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="2">some arrangement for someone else to do the job if I was</text>
<text top="388" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="2">unable to, and you may have no such belief. But the mere</text>
<text top="408" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="2">fact that the roof is mended gives you adequate grounds for</text>
<text top="429" left="621" width="474" height="17" font="2">accepting (1). So although each of these conditional goes</text>
<text top="450" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="2">from the thought of Bennett not mending the roof to the</text>
<text top="470" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="2">thought of someone else mending it, they are profoundly</text>
<text top="491" left="621" width="474" height="15" font="2">different from one another—so different that one could be</text>
<text top="511" left="621" width="477" height="15" font="2">acceptable at a time when the other was entirely unaccept—</text>
<text top="554" left="645" width="451" height="15" font="2">This apparently trivial little matter is actually of great</text>
<text top="574" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="2">importance. Each of these two kinds of conditional does</text>
<text top="595" left="620" width="474" height="15" font="2">important work for us; I don’t see how we could dispense</text>
<text top="615" left="619" width="475" height="18" font="2">with either of them (as we could easily dispense with the</text>
<text top="636" left="621" width="475" height="18" font="2">concept of an event). We need conditionals of type (1) for</text>
<text top="657" left="620" width="475" height="15" font="2">handling states of partial information, assessing evidence;</text>
<text top="677" left="621" width="476" height="17" font="2">and we need conditionals of type (2) in statements about how</text>
