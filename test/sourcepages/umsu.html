<dl>
  
<dt>
<a href="http://www.umsu.de/papers/metasemantics.pdf">Semantic Possibility</a>
</dt>
<dd>
I outline an approach to semantics in which it makes sense to construe
meanings as sets of possible worlds, and raise some questions about
how we should understand the relevant space of worlds.
</dd>


<dt>
<a href="http://www.umsu.de/papers/quidditism.pdf">Haecceities, Quiddities, and Structure</a>
</dt>
<dd>
  I seem to suggest that all truths, or at least all truths we can
  entertain, are made true by the abstract structure of the world.
</dd>


<dt>
<a href="http://www.umsu.de/papers/dt-for-noncons.pdf">Decision Theory for Non-Consequentialists</a>
</dt>
<dd>
  I argue that non-consequentialist moral theories can and should help
  themselves to the framework of decision theory to evaluate decisions
  under imperfect information.
</dd>

  
<dt>
<a href="http://www.umsu.de/papers/options.pdf">Options and Actions</a>
<!--div class="pubstatus">Draft. Last modified: 25 September 2014</div-->
</dt>
<dd>
  I suggest that an agent's decision-theoretic options should be construed as
  primitive propositions corresponding to possible outputs of her
  decision mechanism.
</dd>

<dt>
<a href="http://www.umsu.de/papers/granularity.pdf">Granularity Problems</a> <span class="co">(with Jens Christian Bjerring)</span>
</dt>
<dd>
  We argue (i) that impossible worlds are less useful to model
  fine-grained linguistic or mental content than often assumed, and
  (ii) that it is hard to find a notion of content that is neither too
  coarse-grained nor too fine-grained.
</dd>


<dt>
<a href="http://www.umsu.de/papers/freechoice2.pdf">The (Pragmatic) Power of Unspecificity</a>
</dt>
<dd>
  I give an explanation of various "free choice" phenomena based on a
  plural interpretation of modals combined with ideas from dynamic
  semantics.
</dd>

<dt>
<a href="http://www.umsu.de/papers/triviality.pdf">Subjunctive Conditional Probability</a>
</dt>
<dd>
  I discuss recent triviality results for counterfactuals, and
  different proposals for how to understand subjunctive conditional
  probability.
</dd>

<dt>
<a href="http://www.umsu.de/papers/imaginary.pdf">Imaginary Foundations</a>
</dt>
<dd>
  A defense of sense-datum theory, an answer to the input problem
  for Jeffrey conditioning, and a solution to the hard problem of
  consciousness.
</dd>

<dt>
<a href="http://www.umsu.de/papers/nochance.pdf">No Interpretation of Probability</a>
</dt>
<dd>
  I argue that none of the usual "interpretations of probability"
  provides a plausible account of probabilistic theories in science,
  and suggest an alternative. 
</dd>


<dt>
<a href="http://www.umsu.de/papers/generalising.pdf">Generalising Kripke Semantics for Quantified Modal Logics</a>
</dt>
<dd>
I define Kripke-style counterpart models for a wide range of
quantified modal logics, and prove characterisation and correspondence
theorems.
</dd>

</dt>
<dd>
I analyse the paradox of the absentminded driver from different
perspectives, and make a few general remarks about unstable decision
problems, mixed strategies and the link between objective chance and
rational credence.
</dd>

<a href="http://www.umsu.de/papers/fission-update3.pdf">Belief Update across Fission</a>

</dt>
<dd>
  I complete the update rule proposed
  in <a href="http://www.umsu.de/papers/changing-minds.pdf">"Changing minds in a changing
  worlds"</a> by extending it to cases of fission, and add some new
  arguments and clarifications.

A critical overview of Lewis's philosophy of mind, with some general
remarks on methodological issues.

</dt>
<dd>
  I present an extended counterpart-theoretic semantics for modal and
  temporal languages to account for paradoxes of occasional
  identity. Unlike in standard counterpart theory, Humphrey's
  counterpart at other worlds or times turns out to be none other than
  Humphrey himself.

<div class="pubstatus">In Alastair Wilson (ed.), <i>Chance and Temporal Asymmetry</i>, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014: 81-99.</div>
</dt>

I explain how various Humean accounts of chance, together with
independently plausible constraints on rational belief, entail the
Principal Principle.

</dt>
<dd>
I argue that there is no good evidence that Lewis ever endorsed a magnetic
conception of meaning, and that his actual account of language reveals
convincing arguments against it.

</dt>
<dd>
In some contexts, one might want to model the objects of knowledge,
belief, probability, apriority or analyticity as sentences. However,
this idea faces serious obstacles from mathematical logic.

</dt>
<dd>
I propose a general rule for updating beliefs that takes into account
both the impact of new evidence and changes in the subject's location.
</dd>

<dt>
<a href="http://www.umsu.de/papers/schwarz-metaph-final.pdf">Modal Metaphysics and Conceptual Metaphysics</a>
<div class="pubstatus">
In H. Bohse et al. (Eds.), <i>Selected Papers Contributed to the 
Sections of GAP.6, Sixth International Congress of the German Society 
for Analytical Philosophy</i>, Paderborn: mentis 2007: 520-528 
</div>
</dt><dd>
I compare the old-fashioned view of metaphysics as an inquiry
into broadly conceptual connections with the by now equally old-fashioned view
of metaphysics as an inquiry into modal connections. I argue against
proposals by Jackson and Lewis that the two projects ultimately coincide, and 
claim that we should prefer the conceptual project.

<h3 class="sec">Some older drafts</h3>

<dl>

<!--dt>
<a href="nearby.pdf">Nearby Worlds</a>
<div class="pubstatus">Draft (2007).</a></div>
</dt>
<dd>
  I discuss several classes of counterexamples to the Stalnaker-Lewis
  analysis of counterfactuals, and attempt to defend it by appealing
  to general semantic and pragmatic considerations.
</dd-->

<dt>
<a href="http://www.umsu.de/papers/magnetism.pdf">Lewisian Meaning without Naturalness</a>
<div class="pubstatus">Draft (2006). A predecessor
of <a href="http://www.umsu.de/papers/magnetism2.pdf">"Against Magnetism"</a></div>
</dt>
<dd>
It is widely assumed that objective naturalness plays
a central role in Lewis's theory meaning. I argue that this is wrong:
naturalness does figure in Lewis's theory, but its role is limited and
it could be dropped without great damage.
</dd>

<dt>
<a href="http://www.umsu.de/papers/emperors.pdf">Emperors, dragons, and other mathematicalia</a>
<div class="pubstatus">Draft (2005)</div>
</dt>
<dd>
One of the most intriguing applications of possibilia is the reduction
of mathematical truths. I argue that this is not only technically
feasible, but also supported by general methodological considerations,
that it reflects a natural understanding of mathematical statements
and that it solves most of the philosophical puzzles surrounding
mathematics
</dd>

<dt>
<a href="http://www.umsu.de/papers/parts.pdf">Parts and Counterparts</a>
<div class="pubstatus">Draft (2005)</div>
</dt>
<dd>
Ordinary objects - people, planets, tables and rivers - exist at
various worlds, times and places. But what does that mean? One account
says that things exist at other worlds, times and places by having parts at
these worlds, times and places. Another says that they have counterparts
there. I argue that these two accounts are one and the same.
</dd>


<!--dt>
<a href="frege2o.pdf">Freges konsistente Semantik</a>
<div class="pubstatus">Draft (2003)</div>
</dt>
<dd>
I consider various paradoxes that can arise if a semantic theory is
applied to its own meta-language, and argue that many peculiarities in
Frege's later views on language arise from a (largely successful)
attempt to block these paradoxes. (This paper is in German.)
