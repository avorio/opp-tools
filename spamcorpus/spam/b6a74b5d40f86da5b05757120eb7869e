Works in Progress
“Probability in Fine-tuning Design Arguments.” This paper examines probabilistic versions of arguments for intel-
ligent design of the universe with attention to the possible interpretations of the probability statements involved.
“Internalism, Externalism, and the Error-Statistical Theory of Evidence” (with Aaron Cobb). This paper considers
the error-statistical account of evidence with regard to its epistemological import.
“Two Ways to Rule Out Error: Severity and Security.” This paper explores the concept of the security of evidence
claims through a classiﬁcation of strategies of securing evidence. The use of robust statistics and the programme of
misspeciﬁcation testing are proposed as examples of weakening and strengthening strategies for securing evidence,
respectively.
“Securing Scientiﬁc Evidence.” This paper considers proposes an analysis of the epistemic value of robust inference
in the sense of reasoning from independently convergent test results in terms of the concept of security.
“Parametric Frameworks: Phenomena as Mediators for Statistical Evidence for Theories.” In this paper, I take
up a widely-discussed distinction between data and phenomena and show a surprising role for phenomena, not as
evidence for high-level theories, but as a means for organizing the collection of data to be construed as evidence for
such theories.
“Peirce’s 1883 Theory of Hypothesis and the Justiﬁcation of Experimental Models.” This paper attempts to re-
evaluate Peirce’s later-rejected hypothetical inference of 1883 as a model of ampliative inference appropriate to the
non-inductive justiﬁcation of the probability models needed for Peircean induction.
“The Reach of Experiment: Reasoning Securely About Fundamental Physics,” This is a major research project,
expected to lead to a book on the topic of secure inference from statistical evidence and the accumulation, from
piecemeal tests, of evidence for high-level theories.
