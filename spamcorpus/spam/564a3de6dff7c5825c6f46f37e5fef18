				Profile of the Department


Among all the academic disciplines, philosophy can look back on the longest history, a development over a period of 2,500 years. This is scarcely surprising, since it concerns itself with the most basic questions of humanity and its place in the world, and that with a degree of exactitude which can be found in no other discipline. For this reason, philosophy speaks directly to every human being, and can awaken a particular passion, even if not everybody is sufficiently interested to want to take up the challenge of wrestling with questions and source texts. Points of contact can be found between philosophy and every sphere of human knowledge and existence. 
In Constance, the scientific aspects of philosophy are particularly emphasized, in every sphere of which fundamental questions arise. Thus, for example, there is social philosophy, philosophy of biology, or technical philosophy. Every doctor or businessman is confronted with questions of applied ethics. It is well-known that the foundations of computer science lie in logic. And so on. At the same time, every special area of philosophy finds its centre in the principal spheres of general philosophy - ontology, metaphysics, theory of knowledge, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, theory of behaviour, ethics and moral philosophy. While philosophy at Constance is taught with this systematic orientation, reference to the historical foundations provided by the classical formulations of problems and their solutions remains at the core of both teaching and research. 
Philosophy is not simply a sphere of knowledge, even if its mastery demands a broad base of knowledge. In the course of studying philosophy, less specific skills are also acquired, above all, a training in independent thinking. By virtue of its very nature, philosophy is more suitable than any other discipline for the cultivation of this ability, and it thereby trains students in a skill which is more than ever necessary in our society. This includes the competence to formulate and organise questions and problems, to establish critical standards for their satisfactory solution, and the facility to evaluate the various possible answers, which means to differentiate between substance and appearance in proposed solutions, to further develop the implications of questions and their answers, and in the event, to establish one&rsquo;s own methods and solutions. 
This facility to think finds its immediate expression in a well-developed use of language, the ability to work critically and analytically, hermeneutically and constructively with all manner of texts, and to present the results in clear, concise, structured writing and presentations, avoiding vague and cloudy formulations. 
This general ability to think clearly is accompanied by a particular normative and ethical competence. In virtually every discipline, questions of a normative and ethical nature arise, even if they are rarely treated as such. In philosophy, however, such questions are systematically and comprehensively examined. 
Through the character of philosophical questions and the serious fashion in which they are addressed, every student undergoes not merely a schooling in thinking, but also experiences a particular challenge to his or her personal development and maturity. 
From these introductory remarks, the considerable if sometimes indirect relevance of philosophy for our society and for science should be apparent. The particular place and dignity of philosophy, as well as the problems with which it is especially concerned, are founded in this relevance. 
Aims of the Study Programme


In addition to gaining a knowledge of the subject, students of philosophy should also be able to acquire general skills which qualify them for employment, and this subject is in many respects particularly suitable for this purpose. Such skills include the ability to:


understand complex presentations and to read both informal and technical material carefully;


approach any kind of text or presentation critically and analytically, and to evaluate it with well-founded arguments;


use libraries and the internet effectively;


master complex masses of information with an eye for the essential;



recognise the broader relevance of ideas or material, to establish connections, to remember and to be able to apply them appropriately;


conduct one&rsquo;s own clearly conceived, effectively structured and linguistically precise oral and written presentations in various formats;


be self-motivated;


work independently;


effectively organise one&rsquo;s time;


think independently, critically, self-critically and creatively;



to adapt one&rsquo;s self flexibly to new situations.
