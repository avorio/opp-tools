to (or linked from) certain web pages.

INSTALLATION AND SETUP
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to track papers in PDF and HTML format, you have to
install rpdf and rhtml. See the README file in the respective
subdirectory.

Next, set up a MySQL database to store the tracked pages and
papers. To create the tables, call

mysql -u dbuser -p dbpass dbname < setup.sql 

Then open config.pl and adjust the values for the database connection
and the install path.

Finally, make sure you have the following CPAN modules:
HTML::LinkExtractor
HTML::Encoding
HTML::Strip
Text::Capitalize
String::Approx

Now you can call process_pages to look for (new) links on the
tracked pages, and process_links to extract information from (new)
papers found behind these links.

Of course, there aren't any pages in the database yet. To test the
setup, you might try

INSERT INTO authors (name) VALUES ('David Chalmers');
INSERT INTO pages (url, author, registered) VALUES 
  ('http://consc.net/papers.html', 
  (SELECT id FROM authors LIMIT 1), NOW());

perl process_pages.pl -v2
perl process_links.pl -v2
