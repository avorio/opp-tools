is far easier to despise than to convincingly refute, for two main reasons.
First, its definition is unclear, so we cannot always tell where relativism
leaves off and other views, such as skepticism or subjectivism, begin. Con-
sequently, it can be difficult to tell when a criticism has done enough.
Second, the grounds for relativism are unclear, which can make it hard to
know how to attack it or whether we have dismantled all of the ways of
supporting it."

the notion \x{2018}degree of parthood\x{2019} which is central to the notion of approximation. It also shows how

Humans are unique in the animal world in the extent to which their day-to-daybehavior is governed by a complex set of rules and principles commonly called <i>norms</i>.
Norms delimit the bounds of proper behavior in a host of domains, providing an invisible
web of normative structure embracing virtually all aspects of social life.  People also find
many norms to be deeply meaningful.  Norms give rise to powerful subjective feelings
that, in the view of many, are an important part of what it is to be a human agent.  Despite
the vital role of norms in human lives and human behavior, and the central role they play
in explanations in the social sciences, there has been very little systematic attention
devoted to norms in cognitive science.  Much existing research is partial and piecemeal,
making it difficult to know how individual findings cohere into a comprehensive picture.
Our goal in this essay is to offer an account of the psychological mechanisms and
processes underlying norms that integrates what is known and can serve as a framework
for future research.'

But, is property just a lie, something that in fact does not exist even though we act as if it
does?  At least since the Ancients, there have been many who thought otherwise.  By the
early Enlightenment, many political theorists were developing something approaching a
materialist account of property.  While they may have appealed to mysterious,
unknowable or utterly subjective interpretations of divine will, many political theorists
also described property as a social fact \x{2013} something that exists in the social world as much
as sports, governments and political authority.  Property, on this view, is not an ineffable
phenomenon.  Rather, it has, in a manner of speaking, a tangibility.  It is part of the way in
which people live their lives when they live lives together.",

and questions about logical relations between modal claims are reduced, via counterpart theory, to easily
solvable questions about classical \x{fb01}rst-order logical consequence; and the language of counterpart theory
has greater expressive power than the language of quanti\x{fb01}ed modal logic\x{2014}whatever can be expressed in
the latter can be expressed in the former, but not vice versa. These two alleged bene\x{fb01}ts are not unique to
counterpart theory, since they will be shared by any view of modality which takes as basic a non-modal
\x{fb01}rst-order language, whether it mentions counterparts or not. But Lewis\x{2019}s list of reasons for insisting on
counterpart theory continues: only with the machinery of counterpart theory can we adequately explain the
\x{201c}inconstancy of representation <i>de re</i>,\x{201d} the wavering back and forth of our intuitive judgments about essen-
tialist claims; by appealing to counterpart theory we can solve problems of material constitution, without
being committed either to the existence of distinct coincident objects or to the absurd view that identity is a
relation that may hold only contingently between an object and itself; and counterpart theory permits us to
endorse such haecceitistic-sounding claims as \x{201c}I might have been Frank Sinatra while everything else is as it
actually is,\x{201d} without being committed to haecceitism proper, the view that there are distinct but qualitatively

about philosophy of psychology in the 20<sup>th</sup>century is that, in the last quarter of the

dissolve as philosophers played an increasingly active role in articulating and testing
empirical theories about the mind and psychologists became increasingly interested in the

problems on the bordermarches between philosophy and the sciences.  Sometimes
problems are nagging and perennial because they are deep and difficult.  And sometimes
they are merely an artifact, a shadow cast by our own way of formulating the problem.  I
should like to suggest to you that philosophy of mind suffers badly from being the last
refuge of the best philosophy of science of the 1950\'s, and that some of its problems are
in fact illusions that could be dispelled by consideration of more recent developments in
the philosophy of science.  In particular, philosophy of psychology has been plagued by a
famous contrast between its &quot;ceteris paribus&quot; laws and the &quot;exceptionless&quot; laws of the
physical sciences.  This has led to doubts about the scientific status of psychology, the
status of psychological kinds as natural kinds, and even their ontological legitimacy.  I
argue here that this problematic is a consequence of assuming a particular analysis of
scientific laws as (exceptionless) universally quantifed claims.  This analysis has largely
been rejected in contemporary philosophy of science.  And more recent analyses that take
notice of the role of idealization in scientific modeling both dissolve the nagging problem
and shed new light upon differences between the sciences.',

of the account  are four ideas taken from recent  cognitive science, though most of them

shares important continuities with psychological faculties of other animals, and indeed
that there is a well-distinguished hierarchy of such faculties that extend up and down the
phylogenetic scale.  While it would very likely be a mistake to look at some
conglomeration of these simpler abilities and assert that we have produced a reductive
account of human conceptuality, an examination of these will lend insights into essential
features of human conceptuality in a non-reductive, non-exhaustive manner.  The second
idea is that an important function of both human concepts and of their protoconceptual
ancestors in the animal kingdom is to make distinctions or discriminations.  We shall thus
look at the human conceptual apparatus as being, in large part, a discrimination engine.
How are these discriminations realized in humans and other beings?  Presumably, some
discriminative mechanisms are innate, while others are acquired through learning.  But
how is learning accomplished?  The third idea from cognitive science is that adaptive
discrimination is realized through neural networks, and that the properties of this
realizing system explains familiar features of human thought that seem puzzling when
viewed through other lenses, such as the logical analysis of language.  The fourth and'

etiological account, an approach with a broader explanatory agenda. Concepts of biological
function address two related but distinct issues: understanding biological organisms as complex
organized systems, and understanding the way in which parts have come to be present in
organisms because of their adaptive value. The etiological account focuses primarily on the latter,
treating the complex organization of organisms as a derivative issue solved in passing, as it were,
by explanations for the presence of parts within organisms. This way of treating the issues is
unsatisfactory, however, since the etiological model of normative function fails to provide the
conceptual resources required for understanding the complex process interrelationships
characteristic of organisms as organizationally integrated systems. Among other deficiencies, it
makes normative functions epiphenomenal, it provides a limited account of dysfunction, and it is
unable to adequately characterize multifunctional parts or the organization of densely connected
functional complexes. In other words, although explanations for the presence of traits and
explanations for the way organisms function as complex integrated systems certainly overlap, they
are not conceptually or causally identical issues, nor can one issue be treated purely as derivative
upon the other. Our approach recognizes this and develops an account of normative function that
directly focuses on whole-system organization and process interdependence.'

   For about 2500 years, from Plato\x{2019}s time until the closing decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the dominant view was that the emotions are quite distinct from the processes of
rational thinking and decision making, and are often a major impediment to those
processes.  But in recent years this orthodoxy has been challenged in a number of ways.
Damasio (1994) has made a forceful case that the traditional view, which he has dubbed
<i>Descartes\x{2019} Error</i>, is quite wrong, because emotions play a fundamental role in rational
decision making.  When the systems underlying the emotions don\x{2019}t function properly,
Damasio maintains, rational decision-making breaks down.  Other theorists, most notably
Robert Frank (1988), have argued that if we view the emotions through the longer lens of
evolutionary theory, we can see that much of what looked to be irrational in the emotions
is actually part of an effective strategy for achieving agents\x{2019} goals and maximizing their
reproductive success.  In the wake of this and other recent work, the pendulum of
received opinion has swung in the other direction.  The emotions are now increasingly
regarded as inherently rational, as Frank maintains, and as important components of other
rational processes.

<i>descriptivist view of reference</i> and <i>the causal-historical view of reference</i>, have 
dominated the field.  In this research tradition, theories of reference are assessed by 
consulting one\x{2019}s intuitions about the reference of terms in hypothetical situations.  
However, recent work in cultural psychology (e.g., Nisbett et al. 2001) has shown 
systematic cognitive differences between East Asians and Westerners, and some work 
indicates that this extends to intuitions about philosophical cases (Weinberg et al. 2001).  
In light of these findings on cultural differences, an experiment was conducted which 
explored intuitions about reference in Westerners and East Asians.  The experiment 
indicated that, for certain central cases, Westerners are more likely than East Asians to 
report intuitions that are consistent with the causal-historical view.  These results 
constitute <i>prima facie </i>evidence that semantic intuitions vary from culture to culture, and 
the paper argues that this fact raises questions about the nature of the philosophical 
enterprise of developing a theory of reference. ",
