<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>
In his stimulating book SHADOWS OF THE MIND, Roger Penrose presents
arguments, based on G&ouml;del's theorem, for the conclusion that human
thought is uncomputable.  There are actually two separate arguments in
Penrose's book.  The second has been widely ignored, but seems to me to
be much more interesting and novel than the first.  I will address both
forms of the argument in some detail.  Toward the end, I will also
comment on Penrose's proposals for a "new science of consciousness".
<P>
<H3>1.  The First Argument</H3>
<P>
The best way to address G&ouml;delian arguments against artificial
intelligence is to ask: what would we <I>expect</I>, given the truth of
G&ouml;del's theorem, if our reasoning powers could be captured by some
formal system <I>F</I>.  One possibility is that <I>F</I> is essentially unsound,
so that G&ouml;del's theorem does not apply.  But what if <I>F</I> is sound?  Then
we would expect that:
<P>
  (a) <I>F</I> could not prove its G&ouml;del sentence <I>G(F)</I>;
<P>
  (b) <I>F</I> could prove the conditional "If <I>F</I> is consistent, then
      <I>G(F)</I> is true";
<P>
  (c) <I>F</I> could not prove that <I>F</I> is consistent.
<P>
If our reasoning powers are capturable by some sound formal system <I>F</I>,
then, we should expect that we will be unable to see that <I>F</I> is
consistent.  This does not seem too surprising, on the face of it.
After all, <I>F</I> is likely to be some extremely complex system, perhaps as
complex as the human brain itself, and there is no reason to believe
that we can determine the consistency of arbitrary formal systems when
those systems are presented to us.
<P>
There does not seem to be anything especially paradoxical about this
situation.  Many arguments from G&ouml;del's theorem, such as that given by
Lucas, founder at just this point: they offer us no reason to believe
that we can see the truth of our own G&ouml;del sentence, as we may be unable
to see the consistency of the associated formal system.  How does
Penrose's argument fare?
<P>
Penrose is much more cautious in his phrasing.  In Chapter 2, he argues
carefully for the conclusion that our reasoning powers cannot be
captured by a "knowably sound" formal system.  This seems to be correct,
and indeed mirrors the analysis above.  If we are a sound formal system
<I>F</I>, we will not be able to determine that <I>F</I> is sound.  So far, this
offers no threat to the prospects of artificial intelligence.  The real
burden of Penrose's argument is carried by Chapter 3, then, where he
argues that the position that we are a formal system that is not
"knowably sound" is untenable.
<P>
One position that an advocate of AI might take is to argue that our
reasoning is fundamentally unsound, even in an idealization.  I will not
take this path, however.  For a start, I have some sympathy with
Penrose's idea that we have an underlying sound competence, even our
performance sometimes goes astray.  But further, it seems to me that to
hold that this is the only problem in Penrose's argument would be to
concede too much power to the argument.  It would follow, for example,
that there are parts of our arithmetical competence that no <I>sound</I>
formal system could ever duplicate; it would seem that our unsoundness
would be essential to our capacity to see the truth of G&ouml;del sentences,
for example.  This would be a remarkably strong conclusion, and does not
seem at all plausible to me.  So I think that the deepest problems with
Penrose's argument must lie elsewhere.
<P>
I will concede to Penrose that we are fundamentally sound, then.  As
before, the natural position for an advocate of AI is that our powers
are captured by some sound formal system <I>F</I> that cannot demonstrate
that <I>F</I> is sound.  What is Penrose's argument against this position?
He has two sub-arguments here, depending on whether we can know that <I>F</I>
is the formal system that captures our reasoning.
<P>
If we <I>could</I> know that <I>F</I> captures our reasoning, Penrose's argument
would be very straightforward:
<P>
     (1) We know that we are sound;
<P>
     (2) We know that <I>F</I> captures our reasoning;
<P>
  so (3) We know that <I>F</I> is sound.
<P>
One might question premise (1) - I will raise some problems with it
later - but it does have a certain plausible quality.  Certainly, it
seems antecedently more plausible than the much stronger position that
we know that <I>F</I> is sound.  But all this is irrelevant, as premise (2)
is so implausible.  There is very little reason to believe that if our
reasoning is captured by <I>F</I>, then we could know that fact.
<P>
It might <I>seem</I> plausible that we could know that <I>F</I> underlies our
processing - why couldn't we just investigate our underlying brain
processes?  But to do this would be to change the game.  It is of no
help to Penrose if we can know <I>using external resources</I> (such as
perception inputs) that <I>F</I> captures our reasoning.  For to use external
resources would be to go beyond the resources provided by <I>F</I> itself.
And there would be no contradiction in the supposition that <I>F</I> could
know, using external resources, that <I>F</I> is consistent, and therefore
that <I>G(F)</I> is true.  A contradiction would only arise if <I>F</I> could know
this wholly under its own steam.
<P>
For this argument to be at all relevant, then, we would need to know
that <I>F</I> captures our reasoning powers wholly using our internal
resources - that is, the resources that <I>F</I> itself provides.  But there
is not the slightest reason to believe that we could do this.  If we are
a formal system, we certainly cannot determine which formal system we
are on the basis of introspection!  So again, the advocate of artificial
intelligence is in no danger.  She need simply hold the unsurprising
position that we are a formal system <I>F</I>, but that we can't tell through
introspection that we are <I>F</I>.
<P>
To make his case, Penrose needs to argue that if we are a sound formal
system <I>F</I>, then we could determine that <I>F</I> is sound, <I>independently</I>
of any knowledge that we are <I>F</I>.  That is, he needs to make the case
that if <I>F</I> is presented to us, we could determine that it is sound
through an analysis of <I>F</I> alone.  This is the burden that Penrose tries
to meet in section 3.3.  It is this section that effectively carries all
the crucial weight; if it does not succeed, then this line of Penrose's
argument simply fails.
<P>
How does Penrose argue that we could see that <I>F</I> is sound?  He argues
in 3.3 that we can see <I>F</I> as a system of axioms and inference rules.
Clearly, we can see that each of the axioms is true: if <I>F</I> can see
their truth, so can we.  Further, Penrose argues, we must be able to see
that each of the basic inference rules is valid, as it is extremely
implausible that our reasoning could rely on inference rules that we
regard as "fundamentally dubious".  And if we know that the axioms are
true and that the inference rules are valid, then we know that <I>F</I> is
sound.
<P>
But why should we accept that <I>F</I> consists of a set of axioms and
inference rules?  <I>F</I>, after all, is supposed to potentially correspond
to <I>any</I> sort of computational system - it might be a simulation of the
whole of the human brain, for example.  This will not look anything like
a neat logical system: we will not be able to decompose it into an
underlying set of "axioms" and "rules of procedure".  Rather, it will be
a big computational system that churns away on a given statement as
input, and eventually outputs "yes" or "no".
<P>
It is true that for any Turing machine that accepts a certain class of
statements, we can find a corresponding axiom-plus-rules system that
accepts the same class (or at least the closure of that class under
logical consequence).  There is a lemma by Craig to this effect; without
it applications of G&ouml;del's theorem to draw conclusions about Turing
machines would not even get off the ground.  But the "axiom-plus-rules"
system that we end up with may be extraordinarily complex.  In
particular, the "inference rules" may be just about as complex as the
original system - perhaps equivalent to a complex connectionist
procedure for generating further theorems.  And as before, there is no
reason why we should be able to see that this sort of "rule" should be
valid, any more than we could see from an analysis that an overall
computational brain process is sound.  This is not to say that we think
we are relying on "fundamentally dubious" procedures - it is just that
the procedures that govern the dynamics of our brain are too complex for
us to analyse them as sound or otherwise.
<P>
In this section, Penrose seems to assume that the relevant class of
computational systems are all something akin to theorem-provers in
first-order logic, but of course there is no reason to make such an
assumption.  For his argument to have its full generality, proving that
our physical processes could not even be simulated computationally, it
must apply to any sort of computational process.  Even within the realm
of existing AI research, there are many computational procedures, such
as connectionist networks, which are not decomposable into axioms and
rules of inference.
<P>
(I suspect that even an advocate of logic-based AI might have a response
to make here.  It might be held, for example, that we may occasionally
use certain complex inference rules (when we generate G&ouml;del sentences by
transfinite counting, for example), whose validity is not obvious to us
on analysis, without this in any way impugning the reliability of our
reasoning.  We might soundly "use" a procedure despite its resistance to
our analysis.  This indeed is just what we might expect around the
"outer limits" of G&ouml;delization, which after all is really where
Penrose's argument gains its force.  There is no difficulty in the idea
that the reasoning methods we use in <I>everyday</I> mathematics can be seen
to be sound - Penrose's arguments really apply at the level of our
unusual "G&ouml;delizing" procedures, which rely on our ability to count
transfinite ordinals.  But to be able to see that some G&ouml;delizing rule
is valid would be akin to making that last step in a G&ouml;delization
procedure, the one that is just complex enough to be beyond us.  But I
leave these difficult issues aside for now.)
<P>
It is section 3.3 that carries the burden of this strand of Penrose's
argument, but unfortunately it seems to be one of the least convincing
sections in the book.  By his assumption that the relevant class of
computational systems are all straightforward axiom-and-rules system,
Penrose is not taking AI seriously, and certainly is not doing enough to
establish his conclusion that physics is uncomputable.  I conclude that
none of Penrose's argument up to this point put a dent in the natural AI
position: that our reasoning powers may be captured by a sound formal
system <I>F</I>, where we cannot determine that <I>F</I> is sound.
<P>
<H3>2. Penrose's Second Argument</H3>
<P>
Hiding at the back of Chapter 3, however, Penrose has a new argument
that escapes many of these problems.  It is unfortunate that this
argument was so deeply buried; most commentators seem to have missed it.
Unlike the previous argument, this argument does <I>not</I> depend on the
claim that we if we are a sound formal system <I>F</I>, we would be able to
see that <I>F</I> is sound.  Because of this, it is a more novel and
interesting argument, and more worthy of attention.
<P>
The argument is developed in a roundabout way (which may have led some
readers astray), but is summarized in the fantasy dialogue with a robot
mathematician in 3.23.  The argument is given in a somewhat indirect
form, involving complex procedures by which a given formal system might
have evolved, but its basic structure is very simple.  In a simplified
and somewhat loose form, the argument goes as follows:
<P>
(1) Assume my reasoning powers are captured by some formal system <I>F</I>
(to put this more briefly, "I am F").  Consider the class of statements
I can know to be true, <I>given</I> this assumption.
<P>
(2) Given that I know that I am <I>F</I>, I know that <I>F</I> is sound (as I know
that I am sound).  Indeed, I know that the larger system <I>F'</I> is sound,
where <I>F'</I> is <I>F</I> supplemented by the further assumption "I am <I>F</I>".
(Supplementing a sound system with a true statement yields a sound
system.)
<P>
(3) So I know that <I>G(F')</I> is true, where this is the G&ouml;del sentence of
the system <I>F'</I>.
<P>
(4) But <I>F'</I> could not see that <I>G(F')</I> is true (by G&ouml;del's theorem).
<P>
(5) By assumption, however, I am now effectively equivalent to <I>F'</I>.
After all, I am <I>F</I> supplemented by the knowledge that I am <I>F</I>.
<P>
(6) This is a contradiction, so the initial assumption must be false,
and <I>F</I> must not have captured my powers of reasoning after all.
<P>
(7) The conclusion generalizes: my reasoning powers cannot be captured
by any formal system.
<P>
Strictly speaking, the conclusion that must be drawn is that I cannot
<I>know</I> that I am identical to a formal system <I>F</I>; in showing that I can
see the truth of <I>G(F')</I>, we assumed not just that I am <I>F</I> but that I
know I am <I>F</I>.  But this is still a strong conclusion.  For example, it
would rule out even the possibility that we could empirically discover
that we were identical to some system <I>F</I> - if we were to "discover"
this, the reasoning would lead us to a contradiction.  So even this
would be threatening to the prospects of AI.
<P>
The power of this argument stems from the fact that is does not depend
on one's ability to determine that a system <I>F</I> is sound, or to
determine that we are <I>F</I>.  Rather, it relies on the <I>assumption</I> that
one is <I>F</I> to reach the relevant conclusions, thus contradicting the
assumption.  On the face of it one might have thought that making such
an assumption would show only that the larger system <I>F'</I> could prove
the G&ouml;del sentence of the smaller system <I>F</I>, but the insight of the
argument is that things can be bootstrapped into a situation where <I>F'</I>
sees its own G&ouml;del sentence, leading to trouble.
<P>
As far as I can determine, this argument is free of the obvious flaws
that plague other G&ouml;delian arguments, such as Lucas's argument and
Penrose's earlier arguments.  If it is flawed, the flaws lie deeper.  It
is true that the argument has a feeling of achieving its conclusion as
if by magic.  One is tempted to say: "why couldn't <I>F</I> itself engage in
just the same reasoning?".  But although there are various directions in
which one might try to attack the argument, no knockdown refutation
immediately presents itself.  For this reason, the argument is quite
challenging.  Compared to previous versions, this argument is much more
worthy of attention from supporters of AI.
<P>
On reflection, I have come to believe that the greatest vulnerability in
this argument lies in the assumption that we know (unassailably) that we
are consistent.  This assumption seems relatively innocuous, compared to
the previous strong claim that we could determine that <I>F</I> is
consistent; on the face of it, it does not seem vastly stronger than the
assumption that we are consistent.  But I think that in fact, it is this
assumption, and not the assumption that we know we are <I>F</I>, that carries
the central responsibility for generating the contradiction.  I have
largely become convinced of this through discussions with Daryl
McCullough, and the central argument below (an adaptation of a result of
Lob's) was suggested by him.
<P>
The best way to see this is to show that the assumption that we know we
are consistent <I>already</I> leads to a contradiction in its own right, even
without the further assumption that we know we are <I>F</I>.  Specifically,
we can argue that any system that "unassailably" believes in its own
consistency will in fact be led to a contradiction (under certain
plausible further assumptions).  This can be done as follows.
<P>
In these matters, we are concerned with a system's reasoning about its
own beliefs, as well as about mathematics.  So we can assume it has a
symbol <I>B</I>, representing belief, where <I>B(n)</I> corresponds to the
statement that it believes the statement with G&ouml;del number <I>n</I>.  (Below,
I abbreviate by writing "</I>B(A)</I>" instead of "</I>B(`A')</I>", where <I>`A'</I> is
the G&ouml;del number of <I>A</I>.)  And let us write <I>|- A</I> if the system has the
power to "unassailably" assert <I>A</I>.  (By using this notation I do not
intend to beg the question about whether the system is computational!)
Then the following assumptions are reasonable (suppressing universal
qualifiers):
<P>
(1) If |- A, then |- B(A).
<P>
(2) |- B(A_1) & B(A_1 -> A2) -> B(A2)
<P>
(3) |- B(A) -> B(B(A))
<P>
(1) says that if the system has the power to assert <I>A</I>, it has the
power to assert <I>B(A)</I>.  (2) says essentially that the system knows it
has the power to reason by modus ponens.  (3) says, in effect, that the
system knows (1).  All of these assumptions seem unproblematic.  To
these we add the key assumption:
<P>
(4) |- not B(false)
<P>
which says that the system asserts that it is not inconsistent.  It
turns out that these assumptions, along with the assumption that the
system has the resources to do Peano arithmetic, lead to a
contradiction.
<P>
To see this, we simply construct a sentence <I>G</I> such that
<P>
(5) |- G <-> not B(G).
<P>
This is a standard diagonal construction, and does not rely on any
assumptions about the system's computability.  We define the function
<I>diag</I> in Peano arithmetic so that <I>diag(`C(x)')</I> is <I>`C(`C(x)')'</I> for
any predicate <I>C</I>.  (For clarity, I reintroduce the `' notation for
G&ouml;del numbering.)  Then let <I>G</I> be the sentence <I>not B(diag(`not
B(diag(x))'))</I>.  It is straightforward to show that <I>G <-> not B(`G')</I>.
As long as the system has at least the capacities of Peano arithmetic,
it can replicate this reasoning, so that <I>|- G <-> not B(`G')</I>.
<P>
<I>G</I> is effectively a sentence that says "I do not believe <I>G</I>", much
like a standard G&ouml;delian construction, but without any assumptions about
computability.  It is not hard to see how the contradiction arises.  The
system knows that if it believes <I>G</I>, it is unsound; so it knows that if
it is sound, it does not believe <I>G</I>.  But this is to say that it knows
that if it is sound, <I>G</I> is true.  By assumption, it knows that it is
sound, so it knows that <I>G</I> is true.  So now it must be unsound, as it
has fallen into a contradiction.  This reasoning is easily formalized:
<P>
(6)  |- B(G) -> B(not B(G))   [from (5), (1), (2)]
<P>
(7)  |- B(G) -> B(B(G))       [from (3)]
<P>
(8)  |- B(G) -> B(false)      [from (6), (7), (2)]
<P>
(9)  |- B(false) -> B(G)      [from (2), along with |- B(false -> G)]
<P>
(10) |- G <-> not B(false)    [from (5), (8), (9)]
<P>
(11) |- B(G)                  [from (10), (4), (1)]
<P>
(12) |- B(false)              [from (12), (9)]
<P>
We can see, then, that the assumption that we know we are sound leads to
a contradiction.  One might try to pin the blame on one of the other
assumptions, but all these seem quite straightforward.  Indeed, these
include the sort of implicit assumptions that Penrose appeals to in his
arguments all the time.  Indeed, one could make the case that all of
premises (1)-(4) are implicitly appealed to in Penrose's main argument.
For the purposes of the argument against Penrose, it does not really
matter which we blame for the contradiction, but I think it is fairly
clear that it is the assumption that the system knows that it is sound
that causes most of the damage.  It is this assumption, then, that
should be withdrawn.
<P>
Penrose has therefore pointed to a false culprit.  When the
contradiction is reached, he pins the blame on the assumption that our
reasoning powers are captured by a formal system <I>F</I>.  But the argument
above shows that this assumption is inessential in reaching the
contradiction: A similar contradiction, via a not dissimilar sort of
argument, can be reached even in the absence of that assumption.  It
follows that the responsibility for the contradiction lies elsewhere
than in the assumption of computability.  It is the assumption about
knowledge of soundness that should be withdrawn.
<P>
Still, Penrose's argument has succeeded in clarifying some issues.  In a
sense, it shows where the <I>deepest</I> flaw in G&ouml;delian arguments lies.
One might have thought that the deepest flaw lay in the unjustified
claim that one can see the soundness of certain formal systems that
underlie our own reasoning.  But in fact, if the above analysis is
correct, the deepest flaw lies in the assumption that we know that we
are sound.  All G&ouml;delian arguments appeal to this premise somewhere, but
in fact the premise generates a contradiction.  Perhaps we are sound,
but we cannot know unassailably that we are sound.
<P>
<H3>3. The Missing Science of Consciousness?</H3>
<P>
A reader who is not convinced by Penrose's G&ouml;delian arguments is left
with little reason to accept his claims that physics is noncomputable
and that quantum processes are essential to cognition, although these
speculations are interesting in their own right.  But even if one
accepts that human behavior can be accounted for computationally, there
is still the question of human consciousness, which after all is
Penrose's ultimate target.
<P>
Penrose is clear that the puzzle of consciousness is one of his central
motivations.  Indeed, one reason for his skepticism about AI is that it
is so hard to see how the mere enaction of a computation should give
rise to an inner subjective life.  Why couldn't all the computation go
in the dark, without consciousness?  So Penrose postulates that we to
appeal to physics instead, and suggests that the locus of consciousness
may be a quantum gravity process in microtubules.  But this seems to
suffer from exactly the same problem.  Why should quantum processes in
microtubules give rise to consciousness, any more than computational
processes should?  Neither suggestion seems appreciably better off than
the other.
<P>
Although Penrose's quantum-gravity proposal might at least <I>conceivably</I>
help explain certain elements of human behavior (if behavior turned out
to be uncomputable, for example), it simply seems to be the wrong sort
of thing to explain human consciousness.  Indeed, Penrose nowhere claims
that it does, and by the end of the book the "Missing Science of
Consciousness" seems as far off as it ever was.  As things stand, even
by the end of Penrose's book, we seem to be left in Penrose's position
<I>D</I>: these physical theories leave consciousness entirely unexplained.
<P>
This might seem odd, given that Penrose says he embraces position <I>C</I>,
but in fact <I>C</I> and <I>D</I> are quite compatible.  This is because Penrose's
four positions run together a number of separate issues.  For
convenience, I repeat the positions here:
<P>
<I>A</I>: All thinking is computation; in particular, feelings of conscious
awareness are evoked merely by the carrying out of appropriate
computations.
<P>
<I>B</I>: Awareness if a feature of the brain's physical action; and whereas
any physical action can be simulated computationally, computational
simulation cannot by itself evoke awareness.
<P>
<I>C</I>: Appropriate physical action evokes awareness, but this physical
action cannot even be properly simulated computationally.
<P>
<I>D</I>: Awareness cannot be explained by physical, computational, or any
other scientific terms.
<P>
Note that <I>A</I>, <I>B</I>, and <I>C</I> all concern how awareness is <I>evoked</I>, but
<I>D</I> concerns how awareness is <I>explained</I>.  These are two very different
issues.  To see the contrast, note that almost everybody would accept
that the brain <I>evokes</I> awareness - if we were to construct a duplicate
brain, there would be conscious experience associated with it.  But it
is far from clear that a physical description of the brain can <I>explain</I>
awareness - many people have argued that given any physical account of
brain processes, the question of <I>how</I> those processes evoke conscious
experience will be unanswered by the physical account.
<P>
To really clarify the positions in the vicinity, we have to distinguish
three questions:
<P>
(1) What does it take to simulate our physical <I>action</I>?
<P>
(2) What does it take to <I>evoke</I> conscious awareness?
<P>
(3) What does it take to <I>explain</I> conscious awareness?
<P>
In answer to each question, one might say that (a) Computation alone is
enough, (b) Physics is enough, but physical features beyond computation
are required, or (c) Not even physics is enough.  Call these positions
C, P, and N.  So we have a total of 27 positions, that one might label
CCC, CPN, and so on.
<P>
Question (1) is the question Penrose is concerned with for most of the
book, and the issue that separates <I>B</I> and <I>C</I> above.  He argues for
position P-- over C--.  Descartes might have argued for N--, but few
would embrace such a position these days.
<P>
Question (2) is the issue at the heart of Searle's Chinese room
argument, and the issue that separates <I>A</I> from <I>B</I> and <I>C</I> above.
Searle argues for -P- over -C-, and Penrose is clearly sympathetic with
this position.  Almost everyone would accept that a physical duplicate
of me would "evoke" consciousness, so position -N- is not central here.
<P>
Question (3) is the central question about the <I>explanation</I> of
consciousness (a question that much of my own work is concerned with).
Penrose's positions <I>A</I>, <I>B</I>, and <I>C</I> are neutral on this question,
but <I>D</I> is solely concerned with it; so in a sense, <I>D</I> is independent
of the rest.  Many advocates of AI might hold --C, some
neurobiologists might hold --P, whereas my own position is --N.
<P>
The four positions Penrose describes come down to CC- (<I>A</I>), CP- (<I>B</I>),
PP- (<I>C</I>), and --N (<I>D</I>).  Penrose seems to think that in arguing for
position <I>C</I> (PP-) he is arguing against position <I>D</I> (--N), but it is
clear from this analysis that this is not so.  In the end, nothing in
Penrose's book bears on question (3), which is a pity, though it is
certainly understandable.  It would be very interesting to hear
Penrose's position on just how physical theories might or might not
explain human consciousness.
<P>
Indeed, one might even combine positions <I>A</I> and <I>D</I>, as I do, embracing
CCN.  On this position, human-like behavior can be produced
computationally, and indeed enacting the right computation will give
rise to consciousness, but neither a computational account nor a
physical account alone will explain consciousness.  It might seem odd
that computation should evoke but not explain consciousness, but this is
no more odd than the corresponding position that neurophysiology might
evoke but not explain consciousness.  In either case, consciousness
emerges from some underlying basis, but we need a further element in the
theory to explain just how and why it emerges.
<P>
One can have a lot of fun cataloging positions (Dennett is CCC; Searle
may be CPP; Eccles is NNN; Penrose is PPP; I am CCN; some philosophers
and neuroscientists are CPN or PPN; note that all these are
"non-decreasing" in C->P->N, as we might expect), but this is enough for
now.  The main point is that Penrose's treatment runs together question
(3) with questions (1) and (2), so that in the end the question of how
consciousness might be explained is left to one side.
<P>
A true science of consciousness will have address all of these
questions, and especially question (3).  Penrose has produced an
enormously enjoyable and challenging book, but it seems to me that for
all his hard work, the science of consciousness is still missing.
