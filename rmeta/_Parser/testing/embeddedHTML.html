It is,                 at least, to know facts about oneself. And, in general, knowing                 facts about oneself is not hard. For example: I know that I live                 in Cambridge, that I am now sitting at a desk, that I have a twinge                 of pain in my right leg, that I prefer red to white. But that                 is not the sort of knowledge the Delphic motto enjoins me to cultivate.                 According to Socrates, to obtain the right sort of knowledge about                 oneself one must &#8220;look at the soul; and especially at that                 part of the soul in which . . . virtue resides,&#8221; which seems                 a little harder than finding out one&#8217;s address. This important                 kind of self-knowledge concerns who I &#8220;really am&#8221;                 as a person, or my &#8220;essential nature,&#8221; or something                 along equally lofty lines. Perhaps such self-knowledge is unattainable&#8212;if                 Sartre is right, there is no essential nature to know.</font>               <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">The phrase &#8220;self-knowledge&#8221; tends to evoke theDelphic kind of knowledge of oneself, and it is freely sprinkledaround the metaphysical and self-help sections of bookstores.Contemporary philosophers understand the phrase differently: forthem, &#8220;self-knowledge&#8221; is simply knowledge of one&#8217;s own mentalstates. This sort of knowledge&#8212;our topic&#8212;is commonplace:knowledge of what one is thinking, of what one wants or intends, ofone&#8217;s sensations. Intoxicating Sartrean doctrines such as&#8220;existence precedes essence&#8221; can be discussed when the calvadosis finished: as we shall see, the humdrum kind of self-knowledge ispuzzling enough.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">* * *</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">How do I know that you have apain in your leg? Perhaps you tell me or I see you hopping around orgrimacing while holding your leg. In short, I know that you have apain in your leg by observing your behavior (including your verbalbehavior). Of course, sometimes this method doesn&#8217;t work becauseyou&#8217;re faking&#8212;but usually it does. How do I know that <em>I</em> have a pain in my leg? In the typical case, not by asking my doctor orseeing myself in the mirror hopping around. It is not immediatelyclear how best to characterize the method I normally use to find outwhether I am in pain, but it is clear that whatever that method is,it is quite unlike the way I have of knowing that <em>you</em> are in pain.And similarly for other mental states. I know that <em>you</em> believe thatthe pub is open because I see you striding purposefully toward it; Idon&#8217;t know that <em>I</em> believe that the pub is open by catching aglimpse of myself in a store window, heading for the pub. Usually Ido not need to observe myself to find out what I believe. A person,then, has a special way of finding out about her mental states thatis quite different from the way she finds out about others&#8217; mentalstates. Let us mark this fact by saying that we have <em>peculiar access</em>to our mental states. Contrast this with finding out one&#8217;s ownweight or underwear color: here all the methods of discovery&#8212;usingscales, undressing, and so on&#8212;can also be employed to find outthese facts about other people.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">Consider anotherquestion: can you think you&#8217;re in pain but be wrong? That is, mightyou falsely believe that you&#8217;re in pain, as you might falselybelieve that you&#8217;re wearing hot-pink boxer shorts? Somephilosophers think not: if you believe you&#8217;re in pain, you must bein pain, they say. But even if errors about pain are possible, theyseem in general rarer in the first-person case: I can easily falselybelieve that <em>you</em> are in pain, but typically when I believe that <em>I</em> amin pain, I really am in pain. And similarly for other mental states.I can easily be wrong about whether you believe that the pub is open.More seriously, I can easily be wrong about whether the pub is infact open. But typically when I believe that I <em>believe</em> that the pubis open, I really do believe that the pub is open. That is, ourbeliefs about our mental lives are less prone to error than ourbeliefs about others&#8217; mental lives and our beliefs about ourexternal surroundings. Put more or less equivalently: knowledge ofone&#8217;s own mind is easier to obtain than knowledge of most othersubject matters. Let us mark this fact by saying that we have<em>privileged access</em> to our mental states.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">Although it isfairly uncontroversial to say that we have privileged access to ourmental states in some form or another, its extent can be exaggerated.With the possible exception of sensations such as pain, errors aboutone&#8217;s mental states are not at all uncommon. Do I feel resentment,or is it just irritation? Do I really believe that <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>is a shoddy potboiler, or do I just give that impression to avoidseeming lowbrow? Sometimes others are much better placed to find outwhat your mental condition is, and their discoveries can cost youhundreds of dollars an hour. In the early chapters of George Sand&#8217;s<em>Marianne</em>, it is apparent to the reader that Pierre loves theeponymous heroine, but Pierre himself believes the opposite. And&#8212;assummarized in Timothy Wilson&#8217;s recent book <em>Strangers toOurselves</em>&#8212;social psychology has uncovered our remarkable tendencyto confabulate about our mental lives.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">Peculiar access&#8212;a specialfirst-person method of knowing our own minds&#8212;and privilegedaccess&#8212;easier knowledge of our own minds&#8212;are quite differentfeatures of self-knowledge: the first could be present without thesecond, and vice versa. The British philosopher Gilbert Ryle agreedthat we have privileged access to our mental states, but denied thatwe have peculiar access. Ryle thought that we find out about ourmental states in the same way that we find out about the mentalstates of others&#8212;by observing behavior. Thus, in Ryle&#8217;s view, welack peculiar access. But we do have privileged access, according toRyle, simply because we have much more evidence of our own behaviorthan that of others; we are our own constant companions, after all.&#8220;The turns taken by a man&#8217;s conversation,&#8221; he writes in <em>TheConcept of Mind</em>, &#8220;do not startle or perplex his wife as much asthey had surprised and puzzled his fianc&#233;e, nor do close colleagueshave to explain themselves to each other as much as they have toexplain themselves to their pupils.&#8221; Privileged access, accordingto Ryle, is no more problematic than the fact that one&#8217;s spouse andclose friends are less likely to err about one&#8217;s mental life thanone&#8217;s casual acquaintances&#8212;the explanation of both is basicallythe same. You spend so much more time with yourself than anyone elsedoes&#8212;how could you fail to be the bestauthority?</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">Conversely, one could consistently maintain thatwe have peculiar access while denying that we have privileged access.To see that this is a possibility, note that we have a kind ofpeculiar access to our own bodies. I often know that my legs arecrossed, not by looking, but by exercising my faculty ofproprioception&#8212;a special way of perceiving the disposition ofone&#8217;s body. I cannot use proprioception to find out whether <em>your</em>legs are crossed. And similarly for you: each of us has afirst-person method of discovering his or her posture. But thismethod is not immune from error. Proprioception can lead one astray,and sometimes looking is a better guide. Similarly, perhaps thepeculiar access we have to our own mental states is not especiallyreliable.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">Although this does show that there is no <em>logical</em>relationship between privileged and peculiar access, the orthodoxview&#8212;against philosophers like Ryle&#8212;is that self-knowledge doesindeed have these two features. If this is right, the chiefphilosophical problem of self-knowledge is to explain how we haveprivileged and peculiar access to our own mental states.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">But why is this problem particularly hard? As we shallshortly see, both features of self-knowledge are as mysterious asthey are familiar. Let us begin with a much-discussed difficulty forpeculiar access&#8212;sometimes called <em>the puzzle of armchair knowledge</em>.In order to do that, a small quantity of philosophical machineryneeds to be wheeled in and explained.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">* * *</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">In the firstof his <em>Meditations</em>, Descartes wonders whether there are grounds fordoubting his beliefs, for instance the belief that he is sittingbefore his fire. To that end, he considers the possibility that a&#8220;malicious demon&#8221; has contrived to produce in him the perceptual experience of sitting by a fire, even though there is no fire anywhere, andlikewise for all of Descartes&#8217;s perceptual experiences. If there issuch a demon, &#8220;the sky, the air, the earth, colors, shapes, sounds,and all external things are merely the delusions of dreams.&#8221;However, Descartes takes for granted that the demon hypothesis makesno difference to his mental life&#8212;in particular, to his thoughts andbeliefs. Even if there is a malicious demon, and therefore no firenor any &#8220;external thing,&#8221; this is perfectly compatible, Descartesapparently thinks, with his <em>believing</em> that he is sitting before thefire. His thoughts and beliefs would remain the same whether he wasthe victim of an evil demon or not.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">Descartesimplicitly assumes that one&#8217;s &#8220;inner&#8221; mental life isfundamentally independent of how things are in the &#8220;externalworld&#8221;&#8212;in one&#8217;s surroundings or environment. And this can seemlike sheer common sense, especially to the contemporary ear. Afterall, the brain is the seat of the mind, and the brain is entirely inthe head. So shouldn&#8217;t the mind be <em>literally</em> &#8220;inner&#8221;&#8212;that is, also entirely in the head?</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">This Cartesian doctrine of aboundary between the inner mind and the external world can be mademore precise. Here is a way of doing this&#8212;not one congenial toDescartes, but that won&#8217;t matter. Imagine a person who is a perfectreplica of you from the skin in&#8212;a molecule-for-molecule duplicate,exactly the same in every detail. Such a person would be internallyjust like you, and according to the Cartesian doctrine such a personwould have to be mentally just like you&#8212;in particular, your replicawould have the same thoughts and beliefs. Let us call this claim<em>internalism</em>.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">Of course your body double need not be like you inevery respect&#8212;only in internal respects. For example, suppose youare a mile away from the nearest pub, have some beer in your fridge,have a zero blood-alcohol level, and believe (among many otherthings) that wine has health benefits. A molecule-for-moleculereplica of you need not be a mile away from the nearest pub, or evenhave a fridge, let alone one with beer in it. On the other hand, yourdouble is guaranteed to have a zero blood-alcohol level, since thetwo of you are exactly alike with respect to the distribution andarrangement of molecules. If there is no alcohol in your blood, therewon&#8217;t be any in your double&#8217;s. Now, what about the belief thatwine has health benefits? Is having that belief an entirely internalmatter, like one&#8217;s blood-alcohol level? Yes, according tointernalism: given that you have this belief, your double isguaranteed to have it too.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">Until recently, internalism was tacitphilosophical orthodoxy. But in the 1970s it came under severeattack, principally from two philosophers, Hilary Putnam and TylerBurge. To cut a long story short, Putnam and Burge argued that thethoughts and beliefs of your double could&#8212;if we fill out thedetails of the story correctly&#8212;be different from yours. That is,what one thinks and believes doesn&#8217;t just depend on what goes on <em>in</em>the head&#8212;it also depends on what goes on <em>outside</em> the head, inone&#8217;s environment. (Some philosophers have subsequently suggestedthat this is also true for sensations, such as pain, but we can setthis aside.)</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">To get the flavor of Putnam&#8217;s and Burge&#8217;sarguments, consider another of your beliefs&#8212;say, that Larry Summersis a controversial university president. Will any perfect replica ofyou also believe that Larry Summers is a controversial president?Imagine your double&#8212;Twin You, we&#8217;ll call him or her&#8212;living on adistant planet, pretty much like Earth&#8212;Twin Earth, we&#8217;ll call it.On Twin Earth there is a university superficially like Harvard, witha president who is as controversial as our own planet&#8217;s LarrySummers, and who could pass for him in a police lineup. Thisotherworldly president is even called &#8220;Larry Summers&#8221; by theinhabitants of Twin Earth; to avoid confusion, we&#8217;ll call him TwinLarry. (Note: It is <em>not</em> important to imagine that Twin Larry is aperfect replica of Larry&#8212;there can be all sorts of differences,provided that you and Twin You remain perfect replicas.) Now,Larry&#8212;the president of Harvard&#8212;has always been Earthbound, neverventuring beyond our solar system. And Twin Larry has never been nearEarth, having lived all his life in a galaxy far, far away. They aretherefore distinct albeit similar individuals, like my particularcopy of the last issue of <em>Boston Review</em> (in my bathroom) and yours(on your coffee table).</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">Internalism, remember, is committed tosaying that you and Twin You both believe that Larry Summers is acontroversial president. But is that right? Does Twin You believethat <em>Larry Summers</em> is a controversial president? Of course not. TwinYou has never visited Earth and has never heard of LarrySummers&#8212;Twin You has never met him, read about him, or glimpsed himon the street. Rather, Twin You has heard of <em>another</em> individualentirely, namely Twin Larry, who also happens to be called &#8220;LarrySummers.&#8221; Since Twin You has never heard of Larry Summers, Twin Youdoes not believe that Larry Summers is a controversial president;instead, he or she believes that Twin Larry is a controversialpresident. Here we have two people&#8212;you and Twin You&#8212;who areinternally exactly alike, but who have different beliefs! WhetherTwin You&#8217;s belief is true does not depend at all on Larry&#8217;spenchant for putting the cat among the pigeons but on Twin Larry&#8217;s.In fact, with a little more elaboration we can tell the story so thatyour belief is true and Twin You&#8217;s is false.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">By means ofmore sophisticated and complicated versions of thought experimentslike the one just described, Putnam and Burge convinced mostphilosophers that internalism is false. To adapt a famous quotationof Putnam&#8217;s: cut the pie any way you like, thoughts just ain&#8217;t inthe head! And not just thoughts and beliefs about individuals, suchas the belief that Larry is a controversial president. Internalism isfalse for practically every belief&#8212;including, for instance, thebelief that wine has health benefits. In general, what one thinksabout and believes is partly a matter of what goes on outside thehead: <em>externalism</em> is true. </font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">(Now that we&#8217;ve gotten the difficultcase of belief out of the way, we can note that internalism isclearly false for some other mental states&#8212;loving, for example.Pierre loves Marianne&#8212;but one can only love Marianne if she isthere to be loved, just as one can only kiss or kick Marianne if sheis there to be kissed or kicked. If we imagine Pierre&#8217;s perfectreplica on a Marianneless distant planet, he would not love<em>her</em>.)</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">This just skims the surface of Putnam&#8217;s and Burge&#8217;s casefor externalism, and it ignores a labyrinthine collection ofobjections and replies. But it suffices to explain the puzzle ofarmchair knowledge, which was first sharply formulated by thephilosopher Michael McKinsey.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">Remember that this is supposedto be (primarily) a puzzle for one of the two features ofself-knowledge: peculiar access. Whatever having peculiar accessamounts to, it does not seem to involve observation of ourenvironment or surroundings, as does our knowledge of others&#8217;minds. As Richard Moran puts it in his <em>Authority and Estrangement</em>,&#8220;A person can know of his belief or feeling without observing hisbehavior, or indeed without appealing to evidence of any kind atall.&#8221; Merely by sitting in an armchair and considering the matter,one can come to know that one is thinking of Larry, or that onebelieves Larry to be a controversial president. But the Twin Earththought experiments show that one can have beliefs or thoughts aboutLarry Summers only if one has met him, seen him, otherwise perceivedhim, or heard about him from other people&#8212;only if, let us say, onehas <em>encountered</em> him. And whether one has encountered Larry cannot besettled by armchair-bound methods alone.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">So here&#8212;at last&#8212;is thepuzzle. Suppose that you are idly thinking of Larry Summers. Becauseof the peculiar access you have to your own mental states, you canknow without past or present observation of your environment orbehavior that you are thinking of Larry. Still in the armchair, youcan also run through some philosophical thought experiments and learnthat one can only think of Larry if one has encountered Larry.Putting those two pieces of knowledge together, you canconclude&#8212;again without ever rising from the armchair&#8212;that youhave encountered Larry. But, as noted in the previous paragraph,surely you <em>cannot</em> come to know that you have encountered Larry byarmchair reflection: ordinary empirical investigation isrequired.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">In short, the overthrow of Cartesian internalismthreatens to undermine the idea that we have peculiar access&#8212;inparticular, &#8220;armchair&#8221; access&#8212;to our thoughts andbeliefs.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">* * *</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">Turn now to the second feature ofself-knowledge&#8212;privileged access. In order to explain a problemfor privileged access, we need to introduce a perennially popularsuggestion about the mechanism of self-knowledge: a kind of&#8220;inner&#8221; perception. </font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">We discover how thingsare in our environment by using our eyes, nose, and so on. We see thecat and thereby come to learn that it is on the mat, smell the coffeeand thereby come to learn that it is brewed. Why not say that wediscover how things are in our minds by similar means&#8212;by employinga perceptual faculty specialized for the detection of beliefs,intentions, sensations, and so forth, as vision is specialized forthe detection of colors and shapes? After all, the word&#8220;introspection&#8221; comes from the Latin for <em>to look into</em>, and talkof &#8220;the mind&#8217;s eye&#8221; sounds perfectly natural. (Recall that inthe <em>First Alcibiades</em> Socrates speaks of &#8220;looking at&#8221; the soul.)And how else&#8212;apart from using our familiar senses to observe ourbehavior&#8212;could we find out about our mental states? Some sort ofperception-like faculty&#8212;an &#8220;inner eye&#8221;&#8212;seems the onlyavailable option. </font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">This inner-sense theory has prominentcontemporary defenders. On the plus side, it offers an explanation ofpeculiar access (assuming that the puzzle of armchair knowledge cansomehow be solved). We earlier noted that proprioception provides away of knowing of the disposition of one&#8217;s limbs that works only inthe first-person case&#8212;one can&#8217;t use proprioception to find outwhether someone else has her arm raised. The inner-sense theory wouldexplain <em>peculiar</em> access to one&#8217;s mental states in the samestyle.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">Unfortunately, the inner-sense theory leaves <em>privileged</em>access a complete mystery. As noted earlier, proprioception does notgive one especially privileged access to the disposition of one&#8217;slimbs. So, if there is an inner sense, why is it so much morereliable than our other senses? No one has ever satisfactorilyanswered this question.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">That is the problem posed by inner sensefor privileged access&#8212;inner sense is just another sense, so why isit significantly more privileged in its access to the mind than sightis in its access to external objects? Admittedly, this might be takenas a reason to reject the inner-sense theory rather than as a strikeagainst our having privileged access. And, in fact, many philosophershave convinced themselves on other grounds that the inner-sensetheory is a thoroughly misguided idea. One prominent objection isthat self-knowledge is not as isolated from the rest of cognition asit would be if the inner-sense theory were true. The loss of aperceptual faculty is a serious impediment, but it usually leavesone&#8217;s rationality and intelligence intact. The deaf and blind arejust as good as solving problems as the rest of us&#8212;they simply lacka conduit dedicated to delivering certain information about theirsurroundings. So, if there is an inner sense, one should be able tolose it while remaining a normal rational person. But there is reasonto think that this is <em>not</em> possible. The philosopher Sydney Shoemakerhas argued that a person lacking self-knowledge would be severelyrationally impaired, in which case inner perception cannot be thesource of self-knowledge.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">Unfortunately, to reject the inner-sensetheory is to throw the mezcal out with the agave worm. Arguably, theinner-sense theory is the <em>only</em> way of explaining how one can haveself-knowledge &#8220;from the armchair&#8221;&#8212;without observation ofone&#8217;s past or present behavior. And much putative self-knowledge isfrom the armchair&#8212;knowledge of one&#8217;s present thoughts orsensations, for instance. So, if the inner-sense theory is false, itfollows that we usually do <em>not</em> know what we are thinking or feeling.But we do.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">* * *</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">Let us sit back in the armchair andpause to take stock. The initially compelling claims aboutself-knowledge&#8212;that we have peculiar and privileged access to ourmental states&#8212;collide with externalism and inner sense,respectively. That should prompt an examination of our startingpoint: maybe we were on the wrong track when we assumed that ourrelationship to our mental states is typically a matter of knowledge.It certainly appears as if &#8220;I have a pain in my foot&#8221; is used toreport a discovery, something one has come to know, much as &#8220;I havea hole in my sock&#8221; is. But perhaps appearances are deceiving.Perhaps when you say &#8220;I have a pain in my foot&#8221; or &#8220;I amthinking of Larry Summers,&#8221; you are not stating a fact about yourown mental life, which you know through some strange method and withunimpeachable security.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">What is the alternative? Asuggestion can be found in Wittgenstein&#8217;s <em>PhilosophicalInvestigations</em> (although it probably would not be endorsed byWittgenstein himself). Words like &#8220;pain,&#8221; Wittgenstein writes,&#8220;are connected with the primitive, the natural, expressions of thesensation and used in their place. A child has hurt himself and hecries; and then adults talk to him and teach him exclamations, and,later, sentences. They teach the child new pain-behaviour.&#8221;According to this view, to say &#8220;I have a pain in my foot&#8221; is todo something akin to holding one&#8217;s foot and moaning. A moan is nottrue or false&#8212;the moaner is not reporting or describing anything.Moaning is a natural expression of pain, just as blushing is anatural expression of embarrassment.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">Here we have a sketchof a theory&#8212;<em>expressivism</em>&#8212;that promises to dissolve the problem ofself-knowledge. According to this view, we are misled by grammar intothinking that &#8220;I am in pain,&#8221; &#8220;I am thinking of LarrySummers,&#8221; and the like are typically used to report facts one hascome to know about one&#8217;s psychological life. Actually, &#8220;I am inpain&#8221; is not typically used to report or state anything, and is inthis respect like the sentences &#8220;Pass the salt&#8221; and &#8220;Is thereany more beer?&#8221; According to the expressivist, a more perspicuousparaphrase of &#8220;I am in pain,&#8221; as that sentence is typically used,would be &#8220;Ow!&#8221; If you drop an anvil on your foot and shout&#8220;Ow!,&#8221; you are not asserting that you are in a certainpsychological condition&#8212;someone cannot sensibly reply by saying&#8220;That&#8217;s true&#8221; or &#8220;I disagree.&#8221; The distinctive kind ofself-knowledge that leads to intractable perplexities turns out notto exist. </font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">That sounds pretty radical&#8212;in fact, too radicalto be remotely plausible. Here is one difficulty. When I say &#8220;Youare in pain,&#8221; I am describing your mental condition. There is noneed for the expressivist to deny this platitude, because the problemis not with the idea of mental facts as such but rather with the ideaof a special first-person knowledge of such facts. So &#8220;You are inpain&#8221; describes your mental condition&#8212;truly, let us suppose, inwhich case I am reporting a fact about you. But now notice that youcan repeat back to me what I just said by changing the pronounappropriately: &#8220;Quite right, I am in pain.&#8221; In other words, bysaying &#8220;I am in pain,&#8221; you are stating what I just stated when Isaid &#8220;You are in pain.&#8221; But this means that expressivism isincorrect, because according to it &#8220;I am in pain&#8221; is not in thefact-stating business at all.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">Because of problems like these, asimple-minded expressivism about self-knowledge is not viable. Butrecently, various sophisticated descendants of the original view havebeen formulated. Typical utterances of &#8220;I am in pain&#8221; and &#8220;I amthinking of Larry Summers&#8221; (sometimes called &#8220;avowals&#8221;) aremade without empirical investigation and are rarely questioned orobjected to. The simple-minded expressivist thinks that thesedistinctive features of avowals can be explained without supposingthat we have privileged and peculiar access to our mental states. Inthe case of &#8220;I am in pain,&#8221; the explanation is that this sentencefunctions much like &#8220;Ow!&#8221;&#8212;which, as we have seen, is just <em>too</em>simple-minded. But there might be other and better explanations, andthat is exactly what the thoroughly modern neo-expressivist holds.Dorit Bar-On&#8217;s <em>Speaking My Mind</em> is the most developed version of aneo-expressivist account, which purports to offer &#8220;an account ofavowals&#8217; special security that does not take it to be a matter ofsome specially secure epistemic basis or method.&#8221; Bar-On does notdeny, though, that an utterance of &#8220;I am in pain&#8221; or &#8220;I amthinking about Larry Summers&#8221; makes a straightforward factual claimabout one&#8217;s mental condition.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">Interestingly enough, somethingsimilar happened to the analogous &#8220;expressivist&#8221; view in ethics,according to which &#8220;Stealing is wrong&#8221; is not used to report someethical fact but rather expresses the speaker&#8217;s disapproval ofstealing. Modern neo-expressivist theories of ethics (as developed,for example, by the British philosopher Simon Blackburn) bear verylittle relation to the simple sort expounded early last century byA.J. Ayer and others, but they still find some insight init.</font>     <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">* * *</font>              <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">It is sometimes said that philosophy                 deals with enduring questions that have preoccupied thinkers since                 before the time of Socrates: in philosophy, <em>plus &#231;a change,                 plus c&#8217;est la m&#234;me chose</em>. Science, on the other                 hand, moves relentlessly on, burning its bridges and consigning                 its early pioneers to the garbage heap of history. There is some                 truth to this&#8212;Aristotle&#8217;s astronomical speculations                 are dated in a way his <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> is not. But                 the central problems of philosophy change, too. In the tradition                 inherited from Descartes, the great epistemological questions                 concern our knowledge of the external world&#8212;how or whether                 one knows one is sitting before Larry Summers, and so forth. In                 this tradition, knowledge of our own minds&#8212;that one is <em>thinking</em>                 of Larry&#8212;is considered relatively unproblematic. Arguably,                 it is one of the singular achievements of contemporary philosophy                 to have shown that this has things exactly back to front. <font face="Webdings">&lt;</font></font>              <p><strong><font size="3" face="Georgia">Alex Byrne </font></strong><font size="3" face="Georgia">is an 			  associate professor of philosophy at MIT and the co-editor of two collections of papers on color, 			  <em>Readings on Color, Volume 1: The Philosophy of Color</em> and <em>Volume 2: The Science of Color</em>.<br>                </font>              <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/2005.11.lbi" --><font face="Georgia" size="2" color="#808080"><br> Originally published in the <a href="../BR30.6/contents.html">November/December 2005</a> issue of <i>Boston Review</i> </font><!-- #EndLibraryItem -->            </td>          </tr>        </table>        <!-- #EndEditable -->     </table>  </DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><table border="0" width="778" align="left" height="176" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">    <td height="36" cellspacing="5" colspan="2" NOWRAP align="CENTER" valign="MIDDLE" width="515">     <br> <hr noshade> <div align="left"><font size="2" color="#808080">Copyright       <a href="mailto:review@mit.edu">Boston Review</a>, 1993&#150;2005.
